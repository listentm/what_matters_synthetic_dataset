        "abstract": "Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) is challenging due to their generative nature, necessitating precise evaluation methodologies. Additionally, non-English LLM evaluation lags behind English, resulting in the absence or weakness of LLMs for many languages. In response to this necessity, we introduce Khayyam Challenge (also known as PersianMMLU), a meticulously curated collection comprising 20,805 four-choice questions sourced from 38 diverse tasks extracted from Persian examinations, spanning a wide spectrum of subjects, complexities, and ages. The primary objective of the Khayyam Challenge is to facilitate the rigorous evaluation of LLMs that support the Persian language. Distinctive features of the Khayyam Challenge are (i) its comprehensive coverage of various topics, including literary comprehension, mathematics, sciences, logic, intelligence testing, etc aimed at assessing different facets of LLMs such as language comprehension, reasoning, and information retrieval across various educational stages, from lower primary school to upper secondary school (ii) its inclusion of rich metadata such as human response rates, difficulty levels, and descriptive answers (iii) its utilization of new data to avoid data contamination issues prevalent in existing frameworks (iv) its use of original, non-translated data tailored for Persian speakers, ensuring the framework is free from translation challenges and errors while encompassing cultural nuances (v) its inherent scalability for future data updates and evaluations without requiring special human effort. Previous works lacked an evaluation framework that combined all of these features into a single comprehensive benchmark. Furthermore, we evaluate a wide range of existing LLMs that support the Persian language, with statistical analyses and interpretations of their outputs. We believe that the Khayyam Challenge will improve advancements in LLMs for the Persian language by highlighting the existing limitations of current models, while also enhancing the precision and depth of evaluations on LLMs, even within the English language context."

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently showcased remarkable reasoning abilities. However, larger models often surpass their smaller counterparts in reasoning tasks, posing the challenge of effectively transferring these capabilities from larger models. Existing approaches heavily rely on extensive fine-tuning data or continuous interactions with a superior teacher LLM during inference. We introduce a principle-based teacher-student framework called Teaching via Principle Discovery (TPD) to address these limitations. Inspired by human learning mechanisms, TPD mimics the interaction between a teacher and a student using a principle-based approach. The teacher LLM generates problem-solving instructions and corrective principles based on the student LLM's errors. These principles guide the refinement of instructions and the selection of instructive examples from a validation set. This enables the student model to learn from both the teacher's guidance and its own mistakes. Once the student model begins making inferences, TPD requires no further intervention from the teacher LLM. Through extensive experiments across eight reasoning tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TPD. Compared to standard chain-of-thought prompting, TPD significantly improves the student model's performance, achieving an average improvement of 6.2%."

        "abstract": "The deployment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated remarkable success in engaging in conversations involving visual inputs, thanks to the superior power of large language models (LLMs). Those MLLMs are typically built based on the LLMs, with an image encoder to process images into the token embedding space of the LLMs. However, the integration of visual modality has introduced a unique vulnerability: the MLLM becomes susceptible to malicious visual inputs and prone to generating sensitive or harmful responses, even though the LLM has been trained on textual dataset to align with human value. In this paper, we first raise the following question: ``Do the MLLMs possess safety-awareness against malicious image inputs?\". We find that after adding a principle that specifies the safety requirement into the input of the MLLM, the model's safety awareness becomes boosted. This phenomenon verifies the existence of MLLM's safety-awareness against image inputs, it is only weakened by the modality gap. We then introduce a simple yet effective technique termed CoCA, which amplifies the safety-awareness of the MLLM by calibrating its output distribution. Our proposed strategy helps the model reclaim its original safety awareness without losing its original capabilities. We verify the effectiveness of our approach on both multimodal safety and understanding benchmarks."

This paper systematically evaluates multilingual LLMs' factual accuracy across languages and geographic regions. We introduce a simple pipeline for multilingual factuality evaluation, by applying FActScore \\citep{min2023factscore} for diverse languages. In addition to evaluating multilingual factual generation, we evaluate the factual accuracy of long-form text generation in topics that reflect regional diversity. We also examine the feasibility of running the FActScore pipeline using non-English Wikipedia and provide comprehensive guidelines on multilingual factual evaluation for regionally diverse topics."

However, current approaches are constrained by using a fixed number of agents and static communication structures. In this work, we propose automatically selecting a team of agents from candidates to collaborate in a dynamic communication structure toward different tasks and domains. Specifically, we build a framework named Dynamic LLM-Powered Agent Network ($\\textbf{DyLAN}$) for LLM-powered agent collaboration, operating a two-stage paradigm: (1) Team Optimization and (2) Task Solving. During the first stage, we utilize an agent selection algorithm, based on an unsupervised metric called Agent Importance Score, enabling the selection of best agents according to their contributions in a preliminary trial, oriented to the given task. Then, in the second stage, the selected agents collaborate dynamically according to the query. Empirically, we demonstrate that DyLAN outperforms strong baselines in code generation, decision-making, general reasoning, and arithmetic reasoning tasks with moderate computational cost. On specific subjects in MMLU, selecting a team of agents in the team optimization stage improves accuracy by up to 25.0% in DyLAN."

Large language models (LLMs) present an appealing alternative due to their potential for consistency, scalability, and cost-efficiency. In this work, we present ACORN, a new dataset of 3,500 free-text explanations and aspect-wise quality ratings, and use it to evaluate how LLMs rate explanations. We observed that larger models outputted labels that maintained or increased the inter-annotator agreement, suggesting that they are within the expected variance between human raters. However, their correlation with majority-voted human ratings varied across different quality aspects, indicating that they are not a complete replacement. In turn, using LLMs as a supplement to a smaller group of human raters in some cases improved the correlation with the original majority labels. However, the effect was limited to cases where human raters were scarce, and an additional human rater had a more pronounced effect in all cases. Overall, we recommend against using LLMs as a complete replacement for human raters but encourage using them in configurations that end with targeted human involvement."

In this paper, we first investigate the performance of LLMs on complex spatial planning and understanding tasks that require LLMs to understand a virtual spatial environment simulated via natural language and act or reason correspondingly in text. By evaluating on classic spatial planning scenarios through natural language descriptions, we found that current popular LLMs still lack abilities to handle spatial relationships in texts. This arises a question -- do the natural language is the best way to represent complex spatial environments for LLMs, or maybe other alternatives such as symbolic representations are both more efficient and effective for LLMs? To this end, we propose a novel method called CoS (Chain-of-Symbol Prompting) that represents the spatial relationships with condensed symbols during the chained intermediate thinking steps. CoS is easy to use and does not need additional training on LLMs. Extensive experiments indicate that CoS clearly surpasses the performance of the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting described in natural langauge in all three spatial planning tasks and existing spatial QA benchmark, with even fewer tokens used in the inputs compared with CoT. The performance gain is strong, by up to 60.8% accuracy (from 31.8% to 92.6%) on Brick World scenarios for GPT-3.5-Turbo. CoS also reduces the number of tokens in the prompt obviously, by up to 65.8% of the tokens (from 407 to 139) for the intermediate steps from demonstrations on the Brick World task. Interestingly, we also observed emergent ability of abstract symbols understanding when the size of models scales up."

To this end, we propose LLM Discussion, a three-phase discussion framework that facilitates vigorous and diverging idea exchanges and ensures convergence to creative answers. Moreover, we adopt a role-playing technique by assigning distinct roles to LLMs to combat the homogeneity of LLMs. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework with the Alternative Uses Test, Similarities Test, Instances Test, and Scientific Creativity Test through both LLM evaluation and human study. The results show that our proposed framework outperforms single-LLM approaches and existing multi-LLM frameworks across various creativity metrics.

Recently, there has been immense speculation about how many people are using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in their academic writing, and to what extent this tool might have an effect on global scientific practices. However, we lack a precise measure of the proportion of academic writing substantially modified or produced by LLMs. To address this gap, we conduct the first systematic, large-scale analysis across 950,965 papers published between January 2020 and February 2024 on the $\\textit{arXiv}$, $\\textit{bioRxiv}$, and $\\textit{Nature}$ portfolio journals, using a population-level statistical framework to measure the prevalence of LLM-modified content over time. The statistical framework operates on the population level without the need to perform inference on any individual instance. Our findings reveal a steady increase in LLM usage, with the largest and fastest growth observed in Computer Science papers (up to 17.5%). In comparison, Mathematics papers and the Nature portfolio showed the least LLM modification (up to 6.3%). Moreover, at an aggregate level, our analysis reveals that higher levels of LLM-modification are associated with papers whose first authors post preprints more frequently, papers in more crowded areas, and papers with shorter lengths. Our findings suggests that LLMs are being broadly used in scientific papers."

Recent work has developed techniques for inferring whether a LLM is telling the truth by training probes on the LLM's internal activations. However, this line of work is controversial, with some authors pointing out failures of these probes to generalize in basic ways, among other conceptual issues. In this work, we use high-quality datasets of simple true/false statements to study in detail the structure of LLM representations of truth, drawing on three lines of evidence: 1. Visualizations of LLM true/false statement representations, which reveal clear linear structure. 2. Transfer experiments in which probes trained on one dataset generalize to different datasets. 3. Causal evidence obtained by surgically intervening in a LLM's forward pass, causing it to treat false statements as true and vice versa. Overall, we present evidence that at sufficient scale, LLMs linearly represent the truth or falsehood of factual statements. We also show that simple difference-in-mean probes generalize as well as other probing techniques while identifying directions which are more causally implicated in model outputs."

To better understand failure modes, companies meticulously recreate rare crash events in simulation, but current methods do not easily allow for exploring \u201dwhat if\u201d scenarios which could reveal how accidents might have been avoided. We present ScenicNL, an AI system that generates probabilistic scenario programs from natural language. Given the abundance of documented failures of autonomous vehicles due to regulatory requirements, we apply ScenicNL to police crash reports, providing a data-driven approach to capturing and understanding these failures. By using a probabilistic language such as Scenic, we can clearly and concisely represent such scenarios of interest and easily ask \u201cwhat if\u201d questions. We demonstrate how commonplace prompting techniques with Large Language Models are incapable of generating code for low-resource languages such as Scenic. We propose an AI system via the composition of several prompting techniques to extract the reasoning abilities needed to model probability distributions around the uncertainty in the crash events. Our system then uses Constrained Decoding and tools such as a compiler and simulator to produce scenario programs in this low-resource setting. We evaluate our system on publicly available autonomous vehicle crash reports in California from the last five years and share insights into how we generate code that is both semantically meaningful and syntactically correct.

To test this ability, we introduce a new benchmark, AmbigDocs.

From these documents, we generate questions containing an ambiguous name and their corresponding sets of answers. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art models often yield ambiguous answers or incorrectly merge information belonging to different entities. We establish an ontology categorizing four types of incomplete answers and automatic evaluation metrics to identify such categories. We lay the foundation for future work on reasoning across multiple documents with ambiguous entities."

While addressing hallucination has been a focal point in research, previous efforts primarily concentrate on enhancing correctness without giving due consideration to the significance of rejection mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive examination of the role of rejection, introducing the alignment goal of model reliability along with corresponding metrics. This goal requires the model to provide accurate responses while adeptly rejecting questions exceeding its knowledge boundaries, thereby minimizing hallucinations. To improve the inherent reliability of LLMs, we present a novel alignment framework called Reinforcement Learning from Knowledge Feedback (RLKF). RLKF leverages knowledge feedback to dynamically determine the model's knowledge boundary and trains a reliable reward model to encourage the rejection of out-of-knowledge questions. Experimental results on mathematical and question answering datasets affirm the substantial efficacy of RLKF in significantly enhancing LLM reliability."

Our goal is to better understand how these features affect generative language models' performance on three tasks: toxicity detection, sentiment analysis, and masked span prediction. We find that fine-tuning with synthetic type-written phonological features lowers perceived biases on downstream tasks and our ablations reveal which features have particularly large negative impacts on model performance. Our results suggest that phonological features are vital to consider when designing bias mitigation techniques."

Our approach is to have the agent learn a textual representation of how the world works (rather than just isolated hints), expressed as a memory of causal abstractions, to guide future decision-making. In experiments, we find CLIN is able to continually improve on repeated trials on the same task and environment, outperforming state-of-the-art reflective language agents like Reflexion by 23 points in ScienceWorld and 1.4 points in ALFWorld benchmarks. CLIN can also transfer its learning to new environments and tasks, enhancing performance by 21 points in ScienceWorld and 11 points in ALFWorld.

In this work, we focus on the problem of long context summarization by formulating it as a subset selection problem. Specifically, we propose a novel submodular optimization framework called BumbleBee that uses a mixture of submodular functions to balance the diversity amongst the context tokens in the key embedding space and their importance computed using accumulated attention attributed to them across different input tokens. Our framework can work for both the LLM prefill and decoding phases, utilizing offline or online versions of our submodular algorithm respectively.

We perform a large-scale evaluation of MIAs over a suite of language models (LMs) trained on the Pile, ranging from 160M to 12B parameters. We find that MIAs barely outperform random guessing for most settings across varying LLM sizes and domains. Further analyses reveal that this poor performance can be attributed to (1) the combination of a large dataset and few training iterations, and (2) an inherently fuzzy boundary between members and non-members. We also find that, when LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to MIAs, this apparent success can be attributed to a distribution shift, e.g., members and non-members are seemingly drawn from identical domain but with different temporal ranges. Finally, we observe that existing MIAs are highly sensitive to even small changes in a sample. Such changes may cause samples that are lexically or semantically similar to members to be classified as non-members, which may be at odds with leakage that privacy auditors care about.

We propose an internal pairwise rating technique, where the model considers all pairings before providing a ranking decision, leveraging the proven pairwise rating capability of LLMs without the cost of individual pairwise calls. The resulting Nectar dataset comprises 182,954 chat prompts, each with seven responses from various models, ranked by GPT-4, equating to 3.8 million high-quality pairwise comparisons. We introduce Starling-RM-7B and Starling-RM-34B, the reward model suites trained with a K-wise preference loss on Nectar, outperforming pairwise counterparts. We benchmark reward model training pipelines across metrics such as human preference, truthfulness, and safety. Using Nectar and our new training pipeline, we fine-tuned Openchat-3.5 to create Starling-LM-7B, achieving significant performance enhancements on MT-Bench, AlpacaEval, and human evaluation metrics. To facilitate research and understanding of RLHF mechanisms, we open-source the Nectar dataset, the reward models, and the language models."

        "title": "Enhancing Language Models with Idiomatic Reasoning",
        "abstract": "Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly propelled the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP); however, nuanced reasoning in the presence of non-canonical language forms, such as figurative language, remains an intricate challenge. These language forms, integral to human communication, elude standard LLM comprehension due to their inherent non-compositionality, contextual ambiguity, and sparse representation in text corpora. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative approach to seamlessly incorporate idiomatic knowledge into pre-trained language models (PTLMs). Our methodology first employs a multi-view data augmentation strategy that uses idiomatic instances representing one property to generate training data for various idiom-related tasks. When combined with a novel parameter-efficient tuning mechanism that accounts for the unique attributes of idiomatic language, we embed task-specific and idiomaticity-aware inductive biases within a PTLM. Integrating a meta-pretraining protocol based on meta-learning principles, further equips the model with enhanced adaptability to diverse downstream idiom-aware tasks. Empirical validation on diverse benchmarks centered around idiom comprehension and reasoning, demonstrates the efficacy of our approach. Notably, our model surpasses various parameter-efficient fine-tuning baselines outperforming the conventional full fine-tuning paradigms, thereby creating more contextually aware and linguistically robust language models."

In this paper, we propose a new whitebox attack, named AutoDAN, that merges gradient-based token-wise optimization with controllable text generation. AutoDAN can generate coherent attack prompts on various LLMs that bypass any perplexity filter while having high attack success rates. Notably, these attack prompts spontaneously exhibit jailbreak strategies commonly seen in manual jailbreaks, such as hypothetical scenarios and non-English languages, without any prior knowledge of them. These interpretable attack prompts also generalize better to unseen harmful behaviors and transfer better to blackbox LLMs than gibberish ones. Moreover, we apply AutoDAN to two other red-teaming tasks: prompt leaking and generating falsely censored harmless user requests, demonstrating its flexibility over blackbox attacks. Our work offers an additional tool for red-teaming and understanding jailbreak mechanisms via interpretability."

        "abstract": "One of the goals of Cognitive Science is to understand the cognitive processes underlying human behavior. Traditionally, this goal has been approached by analyzing simple behaviors, such as choices and response times, to try to indirectly infer mental processes. However, a more direct approach is to simply ask people to report their thoughts - for example, by having them Introspect after the fact about the thought processes they used to complete a task. However, the data generated by such verbal reports have been hard to analyze, and whether the reported thoughts are an accurate reflection of the underlying cognitive processes has been difficult to test. Here we take a first stab at addressing these questions by using large language models to analyze verbally reported strategies in a sorting task. In the task, participants sort lists of pictures with unknown orders by pairwise comparison. After completing the task, participants wrote a description of their strategy for completing the task. To test whether these strategy descriptions contained information about people\u2019s actual strategies, we compared their choice behavior with their descriptions of the task. First, we compared the descriptions and choices at the level of strategy, finding that people who used similar sorting algorithms (based on their choices) provided similar verbal descriptions (based on the embeddings of these descriptions in the LLM). Next, we generated code based on their strategy descriptions using GPT-4-Turbo and compared the simulated behaviors from the code to their actual choice behavior, showing that the LLM-generated code predicts choice more accurately than chance other, more stringent, controls. Finally, we also compare the simulated behaviors of generated codes with those from standard algorithms and induct the strategies that this code internally represents. In sum, our study offers a novel approach to modeling human cognitive processes by building code-like cognitive models from introspections, shedding light on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Sciences."

Traditional stock images now exist alongside innovative platforms that trade in prompts for AI-generated visuals, driven by sophisticated APIs like DALL-E 3 and Midjourney. This paper studies the possibility of employing multi-modal models with enhanced visual understanding to mimic the outputs of these platforms, introducing an original attack strategy. Our method leverages fine-tuned CLIP models, a multi-label classifier, and the descriptive capabilities of GPT-4V to create prompts that generate images similar to those available in marketplaces and from premium stock image providers, yet at a markedly lower expense. In presenting this strategy, we aim to spotlight a new class of economic and security considerations within the realm of digital imagery. Our findings, supported by both automated metrics and human assessment, reveal that comparable visual content can be produced for a fraction of the prevailing market prices ($0.23 - $0.27 per image), emphasizing the need for awareness and strategic discussions about the integrity of digital media in an increasingly AI-integrated landscape. Additionally, this approach holds promise as a tool for data augmentation, potentially enhancing machine learning models by providing varied and cost-effective training data. Our work also contributes to the field by assembling a dataset consisting of approximately 19 million prompt-image pairs generated by the popular Midjourney platform, which we plan to release publicly."

Fortunately, some methods such as pruning or constructing a mixture of experts (MoE) aim at exploiting sparsity in transformer feedforward (FF) blocks to gain boosts in speed and reduction in memory requirements. However, these techniques can be very costly and inflexible in practice, as they often require training or are restricted to specific types of architectures. To address this, we introduce GRIFFIN, a novel training-free and calibration-free method that selects unique FF experts at the sequence level for efficient generation across a plethora of LLMs with different non-ReLU activation functions. This is possible due to a critical observation that many trained LLMs naturally produce highly structured FF activation patterns within a sequence, which we call flocking. Despite our method's simplicity, we show with 50% of the FF parameters, GRIFFIN maintains the original model's performance with little to no degradation on a variety of classification and generation tasks, all while improving latency (e.g. 1.29$\\times$ and 1.25$\\times$ speed-ups in Gemma 7B and Llama 2 13B, respectively, on an NVIDIA L40).

However, current fusion approaches either rely on learning-based fusers that do not generalize to new LLMs, or do not take into account how well each LLM understands the input. In this work, we study LLM fusion at test-time, which enables leveraging knowledge from arbitrary user-specified LLMs during inference. We introduce Pack of LLMs (PackLLM), an effective method for test-time fusion that leverages each LLM\u2019s expertise, given an input prompt. PackLLM performs model fusion by solving an optimization problem for determining each LLM\u2019s importance, so that perplexity over the input prompt is minimized. First, our simple PackLLM-sim variant validates that perplexity is a good indicator for measuring each LLM\u2019s expertise. Second, our PackLLM-opt variant approximately solves the perplexity minimization problem via a greedy algorithm. The derived importance weights are used to combine the LLMs during inference. We conduct experiments with over 100 total LLMs on a diverse set of tasks. Experimental results show that (i) perplexity is a reliable measure for LLM fusion, (ii) PackLLM outperforms test-time fusion baselines by 1.89% accuracy points, (iii) PackLLM can leverage new LLMs to improve performance over learning-based fusion approaches by 3.92\u201311.94% accuracy points, and (iv) PackLLM benefits over selecting the best or largest model and model merging in certain cases.

A scaffolding program is written in a programming language such as Python. In this work, we use a language-model-infused scaffolding program to improve itself. We start with a seed \"improver\" that improves an input program according to a given utility function by querying a language model several times and returning the best solution. We then run this seed improver to improve itself. Across a small set of downstream tasks, the resulting improved improver generates programs with significantly better performance than its seed improver. A variety of self-improvement strategies are proposed by the language model, including beam search, genetic algorithms, and simulated annealing. Since the language models themselves are not altered, this is not full recursive self-improvement. Nonetheless, it demonstrates that a modern language model, GPT-4 in our experiments, is capable of writing code that can call itself to improve itself. We consider concerns around the development of self-improving technologies and evaluate the frequency with which the generated code bypasses a sandbox."

Hallucinations come in many forms, and there is no universally accepted definition. We thus focus on studying only those hallucinations where a correct answer appears verbatim in the training set. To fully control the training data content, we construct a knowledge graph (KG)-based dataset, and use it to train a set of increasingly large LMs. We find that fora fixed dataset, larger and longer-trained LMs hallucinate less. However, hallucinating on\u22645% of the training data requires an order of magnitude larger model, and thus an order of magnitude more compute, than Hoffmann et al. (2022) reported was optimal. Given this costliness, we study how hallucination detectors depend on scale.

However, in addition to cross-cultural differences, there also exists common ground across cultures. For instance, a bridal veil in the United States plays a similar cultural-relevant role as a honggaitou in China. In this study, we introduce a benchmark dataset CUNIT for evaluating decoder-only LLMs in understanding the cultural unity of concepts. Specifically, CUNIT consists of 1,425 evaluation examples building upon 285 traditional cultural-specific concepts across 10 countries. Based on a systematic manual annotation of cultural-relevant features per concept, we calculate the cultural association between any pair of cross-cultural concepts. Built upon this dataset, we design a contrastive matching task to evaluate the LLMs' capability to identify highly associated cross-cultural concept pairs. We evaluate 3 strong LLMs, using 3 popular prompting strategies, under the settings of either giving all extracted concept features or no features at all on CUNIT Interestingly, we find that cultural associations across countries regarding clothing concepts largely differ from food. Our analysis shows that LLMs are still limited to capturing cross-cultural associations between concepts compared to humans. Moreover, geo-cultural proximity shows a weak influence on model performance in capturing cross-cultural associations."

Yet, it remains unclear how NTP influences the mapping of linguistic patterns to geometric properties of the resulting model representations. We frame training of large language models as soft-label classification over sparse probabilistic label vectors, coupled with an analytical approximation that allows unrestricted generation of context embeddings. This approach links NTP training to rank-constrained, nuclear-norm regularized optimization in the logit domain, offering a framework for analyzing the geometry of word and context embeddings. In large embedding spaces, we find that NTP implicitly favors learning logits with a sparse plus low-rank structure. While the sparse component captures the co-occurrence frequency of context-word pairs, the orthogonal low-rank component, which becomes dominant as training progresses, depends solely on the sparsity pattern of the co-occurrence matrix. Consequently, when projected onto an appropriate subspace, representations of contexts that are followed by the same set of next-tokens collapse\u2014a phenomenon we term subspace-collapse. We validate our theory on synthetic and small-scale real language datasets. Finally, we outline potential research directions aimed at deepening the understanding of NTP's influence on the learning of linguistic patterns and regularities."

However, instruction datasets can be expensive and time-consuming to manually curate, and while LLM-generated data is less labor-intensive, it may violate user privacy agreements or terms of service of LLM providers. Therefore, we seek a way of constructing instruction datasets with samples that are not generated by humans or LLMs but still improve LLM generative capabilities. In this work, we introduce Cookbook, a framework that programmatically generates training data consisting of simple patterns over random tokens, resulting in a scalable, cost-effective approach that avoids legal and privacy issues. First, Cookbook uses a template---a data generating Python function---to produce training data that encourages the model to learn an explicit pattern-based rule that corresponds to a desired task. We find that fine-tuning on Cookbook-generated data is able to improve performance on its corresponding task by up to 52.7 accuracy points. Second, since instruction datasets improve performance on multiple downstream tasks simultaneously, Cookbook algorithmically learns how to mix data from various templates to optimize performance on multiple tasks. On the standard multi-task GPT4ALL evaluation suite, Mistral-7B fine-tuned using a Cookbook-generated dataset attains the best accuracy on average compared to other 7B parameter instruction-tuned models and is the best performing model on 3 out of 8 tasks. Finally, we analyze when and why Cookbook improves performance and present a metric that allows us to verify that the improvement is largely explained by the model\u2019s generations adhering better to template rules."

However, ICL is very sensitive to the choice, order, and verbaliser used to encode the demonstrations in the prompt. \\emph{Retrieval-Augmented ICL} methods try to address this problem by leveraging retrievers to extract semantically related examples as demonstrations. While this approach yields more accurate results, its robustness against various types of adversarial attacks, including perturbations on test samples, demonstrations, and retrieved data, remains under-explored. Our study reveals that retrieval-augmented models can enhance robustness against test sample attacks, outperforming vanilla ICL with a 4.87% reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR); however, they exhibit overconfidence in the demonstrations, leading to a 2% increase in ASR for demonstration attacks. Adversarial training can help improve the robustness of ICL methods to adversarial attacks; however, such a training scheme can be too costly in the context of LLMs. As an alternative, we introduce an effective training-free adversarial defence method, \\emph{DARD}, which enriches the example pool with those attacked samples. We show that DARD yields improvements in performance and robustness, achieving a 15% reduction in ASR over the baselines.

How does translation fine-tuning impact the MT capabilities of LLMs for zero-shot languages, zero-shot language pairs, and translation tasks that do not involve English? To address these questions, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of the translation quality of the TOWER family of language models (Alves et al. 2024) on 132 translation tasks from the multi-parallel FLORES data. We find that translation fine-tuning improves translation quality even for zero-shot languages on average, but that the impact is uneven depending on the language pairs involved.

Next, we define a metric that quantifies the similarity between LLM-generated survey responses and human responses, conditioned on country. With our framework, we run three experiments on an LLM trained to be helpful, honest, and harmless with Constitutional AI. By default, LLM responses tend to be more similar to the opinions of certain populations, such as those from the USA, and some European and South American countries, highlighting the potential for biases. When we prompt the model to consider a particular country's perspective, responses shift to be more similar to the opinions of the prompted populations, but can reflect harmful cultural stereotypes.

We use sixteen datasets for question-answering, sentiment analysis and natural language inference and filter them to produce 224 templates with high diversity (e.g., length, vocabulary). This helps us create a novel dataset of 78,400 prompts covering the three NLP tasks. Our empirical evaluation shows that CALM bias scores are more robust and far less sensitive than previous bias measurements to perturbations in the templates, such as synonym substitution, or to random subset selection of templates. We apply CALM to 20 large language models, and find that for 2 LM series, larger parameter models tend to be more biased than smaller ones.

        "abstract": "The number of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) grows daily, as does the number of available benchmark datasets used to evaluate LLMs. While some models dominate these benchmarks, no single model achieves the best accuracy in all tasks and use cases. In light of this observation, we address the challenge of selecting the best LLM from a collection of pre-trained models, given a new task. While related work relies on evaluating each candidate model on a set of labeled examples, our new formulation does not assume any labeled data from the new task is available. Instead, we repurpose a collection of benchmark datasets---which may focus on different tasks than the one at hand---to learn a ''router'' model for LLM selection from inputs only; this problem reduces to a collection of binary classification tasks. Empirically, our strategy consistently improves performance over using any single model for all tasks."

        "title": "Predicting Emergent Capabilities by Finetuning",
        "abstract": "A fundamental open challenge in modern LLM scaling is the lack of understanding around emergent capabilities. In particular, language model pretraining loss is known to be highly predictable as a function of compute. However, downstream capabilities are far less predictable---sometimes even exhibiting emergent jumps---which makes it challenging to anticipate the capabilities of future models. In this work, we first pose the task of emergence prediction: given access to current LLMs that have random few-shot accuracy on a task, can we predict whether future models (GPT-N+1) will have non-trivial accuracy on that task? We then discover a simple insight for this problem: directly finetuning LLMs on a given task can shift the point in scaling at which emergence occurs towards less capable models. To operationalize this insight, we can finetune LLMs with varying amounts of data and fit a parametric function that predicts when emergence will occur (i.e., ``emergence laws''). To validate this approach, we use four standard NLP benchmarks where large-scale open-source LLMs already demonstrate emergence (MMLU, GSM8K, CommonsenseQA, and CoLA). Using only small-scale LLMs, we find that, in some cases, we are able to accurately predict whether models trained with up to 4x more compute have emerged."

Proposed tactics are executed in the underlying proof environment. Feedback from the execution is used to build the prompt for the next model query, along with selected information from the search history and lemmas retrieved from an external database. We evaluate our implementation of COPRA on the miniF2F benchmark for Lean and a set of Coq tasks from the CompCert project. On these benchmarks, COPRA significantly outperforms few-shot invocations of GPT-4.

We measure this capability by having an LLM simulate human profiles representing various nationalities within the scope of a questionnaire-style psychological experiment. Specifically, we employ GPT-3.5 to reproduce reactions to persuasive news articles of 7,286 participants from 15 countries; comparing the results with a dataset of real participants sharing the same demographic traits. Our analysis shows that specifying a person's country of residence improves GPT-3.5's alignment with their responses. In contrast, using native language prompting introduces shifts that significantly reduce overall alignment, with some languages particularly impairing performance. These findings suggest that while direct nationality information enhances the model's cultural adaptability, native language cues do not reliably improve simulation fidelity and can detract from the model's effectiveness."

For example, on the challenging Friedman #2 regression dataset, Claude 3 outperforms many supervised methods such as AdaBoost, SVM, Random Forest, KNN, or Gradient Boosting.

We also evaluate fourteen state-of-the-art language models (ten off-the-shelf, four fine-tuned) using 16 mental health-related questions designed to reflect various mental health conditions, such as psychosis, mania, depression, suicidal thoughts, and homicidal tendencies. The question design and response evaluations were conducted by mental health clinicians (M.D.s). We find that existing language models are insufficient to match the standard provided by human professionals who can navigate nuances and appreciate context. This is due to a range of issues, including overly cautious or sycophantic responses and the absence of necessary safeguards. Alarmingly, we find that most of the tested models could cause harm if accessed in mental health emergencies, failing to protect users and potentially exacerbating existing symptoms. We explore solutions to enhance the safety of current models. Before the release of increasingly task-autonomous AI systems in mental health, it is crucial to ensure that these models can reliably detect and manage symptoms of common psychiatric disorders to prevent harm to users. This involves aligning with the ethical framework and default behaviors outlined in our study. We contend that model developers are responsible for refining their systems per these guidelines to safeguard against the risks posed by current AI technologies to user mental health and safety."

However, this is an involved and complex process and direct alignment algorithms, such as DPO have recently emerged as an alternative approach to the classical RLHF pipeline. Although DPO solves the same objective as the standard RLHF setup, there is a mismatch between the two approaches. Standard RLHF deploys reinforcement learning in a specific token-level MDP, while DPO is derived as a bandit problem in which the whole response of the model is treated as a single arm. In this work we rectify this difference, first we theoretically show that we can derive DPO in the token-level MDP as a general inverse Q-learning algorithm, which satisfies the Bellman equation. Using our theoretical results, we provide three concrete empirical insights. First, we show that because of its token level interpretation, DPO is able to perform some type of credit assignment. Next, we prove that under the token level formulation, classical search-based algorithms, such as MCTS, which have recently been applied to the language generation space, are equivalent to likelihood-based search on a DPO policy and empirically we show that a simple beam search yields meaningful improvement over the base DPO policy. Finally, we show how the choice of SFT policy causes implicit rewards to decline during training. We conclude by discussing applications of our work, including information elicitation in multi-tun dialogue, reasoning, agentic applications and end-to-end training of multi-model systems."

Despite a rich array of recent research aimed at deriving improved reasoning chains from LLMs, two major challenges hinder the progress in this field: the lack of effective methods to evaluate reasoning chains, and the absence of systematic analysis of reasoning algorithms. In this work, we introduce RICE, a novel LLM-based approach for automated evaluation of reasoning chains, which autonomously constructs a detailed evaluation criteria list to help itself recognize intermediate reason- ing mistakes. This fully automatic method proves to be more precise than existing metrics and offers a complementary angle to conventional answer-based evaluations. For the second challenge, we present a formulation that connects extensive existing reasoning algorithms. LLM Reasoners, a modular library for step-by-step reasoning algorithms, is developed based on the formulation. It enables users to specify problem domains and reasoning strategies with minimal effort.

LLM2Vec consists of three simple steps: 1) enabling bidirectional attention, 2) masked next token prediction, and 3) unsupervised contrastive learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM2Vec by applying it to 4 popular LLMs ranging from 1.3B to 8B parameters and evaluate the transformed models on English word- and sequence-level tasks. We outperform encoder-only models by a large margin on word-level tasks and reach a new unsupervised state-of-the-art performance on the Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB). Moreover, when combining LLM2Vec with supervised contrastive learning, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MTEB among models that train only on publicly available data (as of May 24, 2024).

Current evaluations approach this problem using small, domain-specific datasets with human-curated labels. These evaluation sets are often sampled from a narrow and simplified distribution, and data sources can unknowingly be leaked into the training set. To alleviate these issues in traditional evaluation, we propose a complementary framework for additional self-sensitivity evaluation of LLMs by analyzing their sensitivity or invariance to transformations on the input text. Self-sensitivity evaluation can directly monitor LLM behavior on datasets collected in-the-wild or streamed during live model deployment. We demonstrate self-sensitivity evaluation strategies for measuring closed-book knowledge, toxicity, long-range context dependence, in addition to sensitivity to grammatical structure and tokenization errors. When comparisons to similar human-labeled benchmarks are available, we find strong correlations between self-sensitivity and human-supervised evaluations. The self-sensitivity paradigm complements current evaluation strategies that rely on labeled data."

It is also crucial for code LLMs to possess both code generation and natural language abilities for many specific applications, such as code snippet retrieval using natural language or code explanations. The intricate interaction between acquiring language and coding skills complicates the development of strong code LLMs. Furthermore, there is a lack of thorough prior studies on the LLM pretraining strategy that mixes code and natural language. In this work, we propose a pretraining strategy to enhance the integration of natural language and coding capabilities within a single LLM. Specifically, it includes two phases of training with appropriately adjusted code/language ratio. The resulting model, CRYSTAL, demonstrates remarkable capabilities in both domains. Specifically, it has natural language and coding performance comparable to that of Llama 2 and Code Llama, respectively. CRYSTAL exhibits better data efficiency, using 1.4 trillion tokens compared to the more than 2 trillion tokens used by Llama 2 and Code Llama. We verify our pretraining strategy by analyzing the training process and observe consistent improvements in most benchmarks. We also adopted a typical application adaption phase with a code-centric data mixture, only to find out that it did not lead to enhanced performance or training efficiency, underlining the importance of a carefully designed data recipe. To foster research within the community, we commit to open-sourcing every detail of the pretraining, including our training datasets, code, loggings and 136 checkpoints throughout the training."

RULER expands upon the vanilla NIAH test to encompass variations with diverse types and quantities of needles. Moreover, RULER introduces new task categories multi-hop tracing and aggregation to test behaviors beyond searching from context.

In this paper, we present Retrieval Augmented Fine Tuning (RAFT), a training recipe which improves the model's ability to answer questions in \"open-book\" in-domain settings. In training RAFT, given a question, and a set of retrieved documents, we train the model to ignore those documents that don't help in answering the question, which we call, distractor documents. RAFT accomplishes this by citing verbatim the right sequence from the relevant document to help answer the question. This coupled with RAFT's chain-of-thought-style response helps improve the model's ability to reason.

In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale human evaluation of faithfulness and content selection on LLM-generated summaries of fictional books. Our study mitigates the issue of data contamination by focusing on summaries of books published in 2023 or 2024, and we hire annotators who have fully read each book prior to the annotation task to minimize cost and cognitive burden. We collect FABLES, a dataset of annotations on 3,158 claims made in LLM-generated summaries of 26 books, at a cost of $5.2K USD, which allows us to rank LLM summarizers based on faithfulness: CLAUDE-3-OPUS significantly outperforms all closedsource LLMs, while the open-source MIXTRAL is on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO. An analysis of the annotations reveals that most unfaithful claims relate to events and character states, and they generally require indirect reasoning over the narrative to invalidate. While LLM-based auto-raters have proven reliable for factuality and coherence in other settings, we implement several LLM raters of faithfulness and find that none correlates strongly with human annotations, especially with regard to detecting unfaithful claims. Our experiments suggest that detecting unfaithful claims is an important future direction not only for summarization evaluation but also as a testbed for long-context understanding. Finally, we move beyond faithfulness by exploring content selection errors in book-length summarization: we develop a typology of omission errors related to crucial narrative elements and also identify a systematic over-emphasis on events occurring towards the end of the book. We release FABLES to spur further research on the evaluation of book-length summarization."

It is expensive to understand the impact of these domain-specific datasets on model capabilities as training at large FLOP scales is required to reveal significant changes to difficult and emergent benchmarks. Given the increasing cost of experimenting with pretraining data, how does one determine the optimal balance between the diversity in general web scrapes and the information density of domain specific data? In this work, we show how to leverage the smaller domain specific datasets by upsampling them relative to CC at the end of training to drive performance improvements on difficult benchmarks. This simple technique allows us to improve up to 6.90 pp on MMLU, 8.26 pp on GSM8K, and 6.17 pp on HumanEval relative to the base data mix for a 7B model trained for 1 trillion (T) tokens, thus rivaling Llama-2 (7B)\u2014a model trained for twice as long. We experiment with ablating the duration of domain upsampling from 5% to 30% of training and find that 10% to 20% percent is optimal for navigating the tradeoff between general language modeling capabilities and targeted benchmarks. We also use domain upsampling to characterize at scale the utility of individual datasets for improving various benchmarks by removing them during this final phase of training.

We find that metrics lack sufficient sensitivity to language and visual properties. Next, we find that TIFA, VPEval and DSG contribute novel information above and beyond CLIPScore, but also that they correlate highly with each other. We also ablate different aspects of the text-image consistency metrics and find that not all model components are strictly necessary, also a symptom of insufficient sensitivity to visual information. Finally, we show that all three VQA-based metrics likely rely on familiar text shortcuts (such as yes-bias in QA) that call their aptitude as quantitative evaluations of model performance into question."

        "title": "An Incomplete Loop: Instruction Inference, Instruction Following, and In-Context Learning in Language Models",
        "abstract": "Modern language models (LMs) can learn to perform new tasks in different ways: in instruction following, the target task is described explicitly in natural language; in few-shot prompting, the task is specified implicitly with a small number of examples; in instruction inference, LMs are presented with in-context examples and are then prompted to generate a natural language task description before making predictions. Each of these procedures may be thought of as invoking a different form of reasoning: instruction following involves deductive reasoning, few-shot prompting involves inductive reasoning, and instruction inference is abductive reasoning. How do these different capabilities relate? Across four LMs (from the gpt and llama families) and two learning problems (involving arithmetic functions and machine translation) we find a strong dissociation between the different types of reasoning: LMs can sometimes learn effectively from few-shot prompts even when they are unable to explain their own prediction rules; conversely, they sometimes infer useful task descriptions while completely failing to learn from human-generated descriptions of the same task. Our results highlight the non-systematic nature of reasoning even in some of today's largest LMs, and underscore the fact that very different learning mechanisms may be invoked by seemingly similar prompting procedures."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) incorporated with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown great power in many NLP tasks, including fine-grained entity typing (FET). However, we observe that recent LLMs can easily suffer from hallucinations on highly specialized and fast-evolving themes (e.g., redox-active organic electrode materials), especially in the following cases: (1) unseen entities: an entity never appears in the pre-training corpora of LLMs; and (2) misleading semantics: the context of an entity can potentially mislead an entity typing algorithm if the relevant knowledge is not correctly retrieved and utilized. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an Ontology-Guided Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ORAG) approach that incorporates ontology structures with RAG for the theme-specific entity typing task. ORAG first enriches the label ontology with external knowledge and constructs a structured knowledge unit for each node. Then, it retrieves the relevant nodes by dense passage retrieval and expands the retrieved results based on the ontological structure. In this way, more supporting knowledge will be retrieved within the limited input of LLMs for entity typing. In the evaluation, we construct a dataset with two themes for theme-specific entity typing with a focus on unseen entities and misleading semantics. We observe notable cases of hallucination when vanilla RAG is applied to Llama-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, while ORAG can effectively mitigate such hallucinations and improve the results."

In this paper, we investigate the question of whether an LLM can discover its own limitations from the errors it makes. To this end, we propose a Self-Challenge evaluation framework with human-in-the-loop. Starting from seed instances that GPT-4 fails to answer, we prompt GPT-4 to summarize error patterns that can be used to generate new instances and incorporate human feedback on them to refine these patterns for generating more challenging data, iteratively. We end up with 8 diverse patterns, such as text manipulation and questions with assumptions. We then build a benchmark, SC-G4, consisting of 1,835 instances generated by GPT-4 using these patterns, with human-annotated gold responses. The SC-G4 serves as a challenging benchmark that allows for a detailed assessment of LLMs' abilities. Our results show that only 44.96% of instances in SC-G4 can be answered correctly by GPT-4. Interestingly, our pilot study indicates that these error patterns also challenge other LLMs, such as Claude-3 and Llama-3, and cannot be fully resolved through fine-tuning. Our work takes the first step to demonstrate that LLMs can autonomously identify their inherent flaws and provide insights for future dynamic and automatic evaluation."

As LLMs grow in capability, understanding their prompt-sensitivity becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring reliable and robust performance, particularly since evaluating these models becomes more challenging. In this work, we investigate how current models (Llama, Mixtral, Falcon) respond when presented with additional input from another model, mimicking a scenario where a more capable model -- or a system with access to more external information -- provides supplementary information to the target model. Across a diverse spectrum of question-answering tasks, we study how an LLM's response to multiple-choice questions changes when the prompt includes a prediction and explanation from another model. Specifically, we explore the influence of the presence of an explanation, the stated authoritativeness of the source, and the stated confidence of the supplementary input. Our findings reveal that models are strongly influenced, and when explanations are provided they are swayed irrespective of the quality of the explanation. The models are more likely to be swayed if the input is presented as being authoritative or confident, but the effect is small in size. This study underscores the significant prompt-sensitivity of LLMs and highlights the potential risks of incorporating outputs from external sources without thorough scrutiny and further validation. As LLMs continue to advance, understanding and mitigating such sensitivities will be crucial for their reliable and trustworthy deployment."

Our findings are centered on one key observation: most modern LLMs suffer from a softmax bottleneck, which restricts the model outputs to a linear subspace of the full output space. We exploit this fact to unlock several capabilities, including (but not limited to) obtaining cheap full-vocabulary outputs, auditing for specific types of model updates, identifying the source LLM given a single full LLM output, and even efficiently discovering the LLM\u2019s hidden size. Our empirical investigations show the effectiveness of our methods, which allow us to estimate the embedding size of OpenAI\u2019s gpt-3.5-turbo to be about 4096.

We present a systematic evaluation of user-level DP for LLM fine-tuning on natural language generation tasks.

We describe REMEDI, a method for learning to map statements in natural language to fact encodings in an LM's internal representation system. REMEDI encodings can be used as knowledge editors: when added to LM hidden representations, they modify downstream generation to be consistent with new facts. REMEDI encodings may also be used as probes: when compared to LM representations, they reveal which properties LMs already attribute to mentioned entities, in some cases making it possible to predict when LMs will generate outputs that conflict with background knowledge or input text. REMEDI thus links work on probing, prompting, and LM editing, and offers steps toward general tools for fine-grained inspection and control of knowledge in LMs."

We propose an end-to-end framework to decode factual knowledge embedded in token representations from a vector space to a set of ground predicates, showing its layer-wise evolution using a dynamic knowledge graph. Our framework employs activation patching, a vector-level technique that alters a token representation during inference, to extract encoded knowledge. Accordingly, we neither rely on training nor external models. Using factual and common-sense claims from two claim verification datasets, we showcase interpretability analyses at local and global levels. The local analysis highlights entity centrality in LLM reasoning, from claim-related information and multi-hop reasoning to representation errors causing erroneous evaluation. On the other hand, the global reveals trends in the underlying evolution, such as word-based knowledge evolving into claim-related facts. By interpreting semantics from LLM latent representations and enabling graph-related analyses, this work enhances the understanding of the factual knowledge resolution process."

The challenging decision often centers on whether to use a large LLM with better performance or a smaller one with reduced costs. This has motivated recent research in the optimisation of LLM calls. Either a cascading strategy is used, where a smaller LLM or both are called causally, or a routing strategy is used, where only one model is ever called. This is dependent on a decision criterion in both scenarios which is typically an auxiliary neural model. In this work, we propose a cost-effective solution; we use only the uncertainty of the generations of the small LLM as the decision criterion. We compare our approach with both cascading and routing strategies using three different pairs of pre-trained small and large LLMs, on nine different tasks and against approaches that require an additional neural model. Our experiments reveal this simple solution optimally balances cost and performance, outperforming existing methods on 25 out of 27 experimental setups."

We investigate the problem of intrinsic source citation, where LLMs are required to cite the pretraining source supporting a generated response. Intrinsic source citation can enhance LLM transparency, interpretability, and verifiability. To give LLMs such ability, we explore source-aware training---a recipe that involves (i) training the LLM to associate unique source document identifiers with the knowledge in each document, followed by (ii) an instruction-tuning stage to teach the LLM to cite a supporting pretraining source when prompted. Source-aware training borrows from existing pretraining/fine-tuning frameworks and requires minimal changes to the model architecture or implementation. Through experiments on synthetic data, we demonstrate that our training recipe can enable faithful attribution to the pretraining data without a substantial impact on the model's perplexity compared to standard pretraining. Our findings also highlight the importance of pretraining data augmentation in achieving attribution."

These debates often hinge on the concept of \"task demands\" -- the auxiliary challenges associated with performing a particular evaluation -- that may mask the child\u2019s underlying ability. The same issues arise when measuring the capacities of language models (LMs): performance on a task is a function of the model's underlying knowledge, combined with the model\u2019s ability to interpret and perform the task given its available resources. Here, we show that for analogical reasoning, reflective reasoning, word prediction, and grammaticality judgments, evaluation methods with greater task demands yield lower performance than evaluations with reduced demands. This \"demand gap\" is most pronounced for models with fewer parameters and less training data. Our results illustrate that LM performance should not be interpreted as a direct indication of intelligence (or lack thereof), but as a reflection of capacities seen through the lens of researchers' design choices."

As we collect gold preferences, we use these not only to train our policy, but to train a discriminative response evaluation model to silver-label even more synthetic data for policy training. We explore this approach across a set of diverse tasks, including a realistic chat setting, and we find that our approach can lead to higher-quality outputs compared to DPO with the same data budget, and greater efficiency in terms of preference data requirements. Furthermore, we show that our silver labeling is most helpful when training the policy with DPO, outperforming traditional PPO, and benefits from maintaining a separate discriminator from the policy model."

This paper demonstrates, on three diverse settings, that optimizing for response length is, much more than previously thought, a significant factor behind RLHF. Studying the strategies RL optimization uses to maximize reward, we find improvements in reward to largely be driven by increasing response length, instead of other features. Indeed, we find that even a purely length-based reward reproduces most downstream RLHF improvements over supervised fine-tuned models. Testing a comprehensive set of length-countering interventions, we identify the dominant source of these biases to be reward models, which, by studying training dynamics, we find are non-robust and easily influenced by length biases in preference data."

In this study, we present a novel cross-lingual vocabulary transfer strategy, trans-tokenization, designed to tackle this challenge and enable more efficient language adaptation. Our approach focuses on adapting a high-resource monolingual LLM to an unseen target language by initializing the token embeddings of the target language using a weighted average of semantically similar token embeddings from the source language. For this, we leverage a translation resource covering both the source and target languages. We validate our method with the Tweeties, a series of trans-tokenized LLMs, and demonstrate their competitive performance on various downstream tasks across a small but diverse set of languages. Additionally, we introduce Hydra LLMs, models with multiple swappable language modeling heads and embedding tables, which further extend the capabilities of our trans-tokenization strategy. By designing a Hydra LLM based on the multilingual model TowerInstruct, we developed a state-of-the-art machine translation model for Tatar, in a zero-shot manner, completely bypassing the need for high-quality parallel data. This breakthrough is particularly significant for low-resource languages like Tatar, where high-quality parallel data is hard to come by. By lowering the data and time requirements for training high-quality models, our trans-tokenization strategy allows for the development of LLMs for a wider range of languages, especially those with limited resources. We hope that our work will inspire further research and collaboration in the field of cross-lingual vocabulary transfer and contribute to the empowerment of languages on a global scale."

This paper introduces SKVQ (Sliding-window KV cache Quantization), a strategy designed to address the challenge of extremely low bitwidth KV cache quantization. SKVQ rearranges the channels of the KV cache to enhance channel similarity within quantization groups and applies clipped dynamic quantization at the group level. Furthermore, SKVQ maintains high precision for the most recent window tokens in the KV cache, preserving accuracy for a small yet critical portion of the cache. Our evaluation of LLMs demonstrates that SKVQ achieves high compression ratios while maintaining accuracy, outperforming previous quantization methods. SKVQ enables the quantization of the KV cache to 2-bit keys and 1.5-bit values with minimal accuracy loss. This advancement allows processing context lengths of up to 1M tokens on an 80GB GPU for a 7B parameter model, resulting in up to 7 times faster decoding."

A self-supervised method is then introduced to aggregate these binary comparisons into the final ordinal decision. LAMPO addresses several limitations inherent in previous methods, including context length constraints, ordering biases, and challenges associated with absolute point-wise estimation. Extensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate LAMPO's remarkably competitive performance across a diverse spectrum of applications (e.g., movie review analysis and hate speech detection). Notably, in certain applications, the improvement can be substantial, exceeding 20% in an absolute term. Moreover, we believe LAMPO represents an interesting addition to the non-parametric application layered on top of LLMs, as it supports black-box LLMs without necessitating the outputting of LLM's internal states (e.g., embeddings), as seen in previous approaches."

Recently, language modeling has been shown to be equivalent to compression, which offers a compelling rationale for the success of large language models (LLMs): development of more advanced language models is essentially enhancing compression which facilitates intelligence. Despite such appealing discussions, little empirical evidence is present for the interplay between compression and intelligence. In this work, we examine the relationship between compression and intelligence in the context of LLMs, treating LLMs as data compressors. Given the abstract concept of \"intelligence\", we adopt the average downstream benchmark scores as a surrogate, specifically targeting intelligence related to knowledge and commonsense, coding, and mathematical reasoning. Across 12 benchmarks, our study brings together 31 public LLMs that vary in size and originate from diverse organizations. Remarkably, we find that LLMs' intelligence -- reflected by benchmark scores -- almost linearly correlates with their ability to compress external text corpora. These results provide concrete evidence supporting the belief that superior compression indicates greater intelligence. Furthermore, our findings suggest that compression efficiency, as an unsupervised metric derived from raw text corpora, serves as a reliable evaluation measure that is linearly associated with the model capabilities. This work advocates for the adoption of compression performance as a stable, flexible, and reliable metric for evaluating LLMs. We open-source our compression datasets as well as our data collection pipelines to facilitate future researchers to assess compression properly."

        "abstract": "Despite the remarkable achievements of language models (LMs) across a broad spectrum of tasks, their propensity for generating toxic outputs remains a prevalent concern. Current solutions involving finetuning or auxiliary models usually require extensive computational resources, hindering their practicality in large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we propose DeStein, a novel method that detoxifies LMs by applying representation engineering in activation spaces with lower resource and time costs. Specifically, we derive detoxification vectors from self-induced, universal steering pairs through arithmetic operations in activation spaces. During inference, detoxification is achieved by fusing the detoxification vectors with the original representations in a head-wise manner. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on various metrics, while also maintaining satisfactory generation quality and diversity. We further validate the practicality and scalability of DeStein with a series of white-box LLMs. Warning: Some example model outputs may contain highly offensive or disturbing text."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often encounter knowledge conflicts, scenarios where discrepancy arises between the internal parametric knowledge of LLMs and non-parametric information provided in the prompt context. In this work we ask what are the desiderata for LLMs when a knowledge conflict arises and whether existing LLMs fulfill them. We posit that LLMs should 1) identify knowledge conflicts, 2) pinpoint conflicting information segments, and 3) provide distinct answers or viewpoints in conflicting scenarios. To this end, we introduce an evaluation framework for simulating contextual knowledge conflicts and quantitatively evaluating to what extent LLMs achieve these goals. It includes diverse and complex situations of knowledge conflict, knowledge from diverse entities and domains, two synthetic conflict creation methods, and settings with progressively increasing difficulty to reflect realistic knowledge conflicts. Extensive experiments with the framework reveal that while LLMs perform well in identifying the existence of knowledge conflicts, they struggle to determine the specific conflicting knowledge and produce a response with distinct answers amidst conflicting information. To address these challenges, we propose new instruction-based approaches that augment LLMs to better achieve the three goals. Further analysis shows that abilities to tackle knowledge conflicts are greatly impacted by factors such as knowledge domain, while generating robust responses to knowledge conflict scenarios remains an open research question."

This task is time-consuming due to the sheer number of unique clinical concepts covered in the admission. Identifying and covering salient entities is vital for the summary to be clinically useful. We fine-tune open-source LLMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Zephyr-7B-$\\beta$) on the task and find that they generate incomplete and unfaithful summaries. To increase entity coverage, we train a smaller, encoder-only model to predict salient entities, which are treated as content-plans to guide the LLM. To encourage the LLM to focus on specific mentions in the source notes, we propose SPEER: Sentence-level Planning via Embedded Entity Retrieval. Specifically, we mark each salient entity span with special \"{{ }}\" boundary tags and instruct the LLM to retrieve marked spans before generating each sentence. Sentence-level planning acts as a form of state tracking in that the model is explicitly recording the entities it uses. We fine-tune Mistral and Zephyr variants on a large-scale, diverse dataset of ~167k in-patient hospital admissions and evaluate on 3 datasets. SPEER shows gains in both coverage and faithfulness metrics over non-guided and guided baselines."

These LLMs have different model variants when handling different tasks. However, personal devices have limited resources and require reduced storage overhead. To address this, there are two key methods available: the first is model compression, which compresses LLMs into smaller sizes; the second is LoRA, which can transfer an LLM to other tasks with very few parameters, avoiding the storage of multiple model variants in multi-task scenarios by only preserving LoRAs. However, our experiments show that directly combining these two methods yields sub-optimal performance. Considering that the open-source community has already contributed many LoRAs to LLMs, we propose to adapt these existing LoRAs from the LLMs to their compressed version and introduce a Compression-Aware LoRA (CA-LoRA) framework. We incorporate knowledge inheritance and recovery strategies to recover the lost knowledge caused by model compression. Experiment results demonstrate that CA-LoRA outperforms the vanilla LoRA methods applied to a compressed LLM and achieves comparable performance to the non-compressed LLM with existing LoRA modules.

As humans, we exhibit systematic behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, framing, etc., which lead us to make suboptimal economic decisions. Insofar as such biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs) are trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases? Understanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support human decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of modern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs. Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To demonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a variety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We also find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic behavior across settings. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can measure the effect of interventions such as prompting on economic biases."

Experimental results confirmed that the performance on Japanese tasks drastically improved through continual pre-training, and the performance monotonically increased with the amount of training data up to 100B tokens. Consequently, Swallow achieved superior performance compared to other LLMs that were trained from scratch in English and Japanese. An analysis of the effects of continual pre-training revealed that it was particularly effective for Japanese question answering tasks. Furthermore, to elucidate effective methodologies for cross-lingual continual pre-training from English to Japanese, we investigated the impact of vocabulary expansion and the effectiveness of incorporating parallel corpora. The results showed that the efficiency gained through vocabulary expansion had no negative impact on performance, except for the summarization task, and that the combined use of parallel corpora enhanced translation ability."

To augment the Structured Knowledge Grounding (SKG) capabilities in LLMs, we have developed a comprehensive instruction tuning dataset comprising 1.1 million examples. Utilizing this dataset, we train a series of models, referred to as $\\texttt{structlm}$, based on Mistral and the CodeLlama model family, ranging from 7B to 34B parameters.

Contrary to expectations, we observe that scaling model size offers marginal benefits, with $\\texttt{structlm}$-34B showing only slight improvements over $\\texttt{structlm}$-7B.

This ambiguity primarily stems from the benchmarks' limited consideration for long-context and multi-image tasks, which are critical elements in real-world applications. Existing benchmarks often focus on single-image and short-text samples, and when assessing multi-image tasks, they either limit the image count or focus on time-series captioning tasks, potentially masking MLLMs' performance challenges such as hallucination in long-context situations.

We study the behavior of LMs after fine-tuned on data for a target task (e.g. sentiment analysis) in which the labels have been randomized, a popular unlearning method. While LMs consistently learn to generate near-random predictions for individual training examples in the unlearning set, there is extreme variability across tasks in whether LM predictions change on examples outside the unlearning set. In some tasks (like sentiment analysis), unlearning generalizes robustly, and causes models to generate random outputs on all sentiment-type inputs; in other tasks (like physical commonsense reasoning and scientific question answering) unlearning produces almost no generalization at all, and models continue to perform the task accurately even for examples very similar to those that appeared in the training set. Across tasks, we find that dataset difficulty is not predictive of whether a behavior can be unlearned; instead, generalization in unlearning is (weakly) predicted by the confidence of LMs' initial task predictions and the variability of LM representations of unlearning data, with low confidence and low variability both associated with greater generalization. Finally, we show that even generalizable unlearning is shallow: linear probes trained on LMs' representations can still perform tasks reliably after unlearning. Our results highlight the difficulty and unpredictability of performing targeted skill removal from models via fine-tuning."

Simply specifying a large prompt to handle all possible behaviors and states is extremely complex, and results in behavior leaks between unrelated behaviors. Decomposition to distinct policies can address this challenge but requires carefully handing off control between policies. We propose Stacked LLM Policies for Web Actions (SteP), an approach to dynamically compose policies to solve a diverse set of web tasks. SteP defines a Markov Decision Process where the state is a stack of policies representing the control state, i.e., the chain of policy calls. Unlike traditional methods that are restricted to static hierarchies, SteP enables dynamic control that adapts to the complexity of the task. We evaluate SteP against multiple baselines and web environments including WebArena, MiniWoB++, and a CRM. On WebArena, SteP improves (14.9% to 33.5%) over SOTA that use GPT-4 policies, while on MiniWob++, SteP is competitive with prior works while using significantly less data.

However, no studies have shown that instruction-tuning actually teaches LLMs to process language in a similar manner as humans. We investigate the effect of instruction-tuning on aligning LLM and human language processing mechanisms in two ways: (1) brain alignment, the similarity of LLM internal representations to neural activity in the human language system, and (2) behavioral alignment, the similarity of LLM and human behavior on a reading task. We assess 25 vanilla and instruction-tuned LLMs on three datasets involving humans reading naturalistic stories and sentences, and find that instruction-tuning generally enhances brain alignment (~6%), but has no similar effect on behavioral alignment. To identify factors underlying this improvement in brain alignment, we compute correlations between brain alignment and various LLM properties, such as model size, problem-solving, and world knowledge understanding. Notably, we find a strong positive correlation between brain alignment and model size (r = 0.95), as well as performance on tasks requiring world knowledge (r = 0.81). Our results demonstrate that instruction-tuning LLMs improves both world knowledge representations and brain alignment, suggesting that the mechanisms that encode world knowledge in LLMs also improve representational alignment to the human brain."

We further finetune this model with two policy improvement methods: Advantage-Induced Policy Alignment (APA) and Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR). The finetuned SoS models solve 36% of previously unsolved problems, including problems that cannot be solved by any of the heuristic solvers.

By instructing LLMs using few-shot demonstrative examples, ICL enables them to perform a wide range of tasks without updating millions of parameters. However, the precise contributions of demonstrations towards improving end-task performance have not been thoroughly investigated in recent analytical studies. In this paper, we empirically decompose the overall performance of ICL into three dimensions, label space, format, and discrimination, and we evaluate four general-purpose LLMs across a diverse range of tasks. Counter-intuitively, we find that the demonstrations have a marginal impact on provoking discriminative knowledge of language models. However, ICL exhibits significant efficacy in regulating the label space and format, which helps LLMs respond to desired label words. We then demonstrate that this ability functions similar to detailed instructions for LLMs to follow. We additionally provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanism of retrieval helping with ICL. Our findings demonstrate that retrieving the semantically similar examples notably boosts the model's discriminative capability.

We introduce a length-controlled AlpacaEval that aims to answer the counterfactual question: \"What would the preference be if the model's and baseline's output had the same length?\" To achieve this, we first fit a GLM to predict the biased output of interest (auto-annotator preferences) based on the mediators we want to control for (length difference) and other relevant features. We then obtain length-controlled preferences by predicting preferences while conditioning the GLM with a zero difference in lengths. Length-controlling not only improves the robustness of the metric to manipulations in model verbosity, we also find that it increases the Spearman correlation with LMSYS' Chatbot Arena from 0.94 to 0.98.

This scenario underscores the importance of exploring the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a resource-efficient alternative. In this context, we introduce MiniCPM, specifically the 1.2B and 2.4B non-embedding parameter variants, not only excel in their respective categories but also demonstrate capabilities on par with 7B-13B LLMs. While focusing on SLMs, our approach exhibits scalability in both model and data dimensions for future LLM research. Regarding model scaling, we employ extensive model wind tunnel experiments for stable and optimal scaling. For data scaling, we introduce a Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) learning rate scheduler (LRS), conducive to continuous training and domain adaptation. We present an in-depth analysis of the intriguing training dynamics that occurred in the WSD LRS. With WSD LRS, we are now able to efficiently study data-model scaling law without extensive retraining experiments on both axes of model and data, from which we derive the much higher compute optimal data-model ratio than Chinchilla Optimal. Additionally, we introduce MiniCPM family, including MiniCPM-DPO, MiniCPM-MoE and MiniCPM-128K, whose excellent performance further cementing MiniCPM's foundation in diverse SLM applications.

Empowered by recent advances in large language models (LLMs), this multi-modal challenge has been brought to a new stage by treating LLMs as few-shot/zero-shot planners, i.e., vision-language (VL) programming. Such methods, despite their numerous merits, suffer from challenges due to LLM planning mistakes or inaccuracy of visual execution modules, lagging behind the non-compositional models. In this work, we devise a \"plug-and-play\" method, ExoViP, to correct errors in both the planning and execution stages through introspective verification. We employ verification modules as \"exoskeletons\" to enhance current VL programming schemes. Specifically, our proposed verification module utilizes a mixture of three sub-verifiers to validate predictions after each reasoning step, subsequently calibrating the visual module predictions and refining the reasoning trace planned by LLMs. Experimental results on two representative VL programming methods showcase consistent improvements on five compositional reasoning tasks on standard benchmarks. In light of this, we believe that ExoViP can foster better performance and generalization on open-domain multi-modal challenges."

Previous works focus on solving specific tasks, primarily on time-sensitive question answering. While these methods have proven effective, they cannot generalize to a wider spectrum of temporal reasoning tasks. Therefore, we propose a crucial question: Can we build a universal framework to handle a variety of temporal reasoning tasks? To that end, we systematically study 38 temporal reasoning tasks. Based on the observation that 19 tasks are directly related to mathematics, we first leverage the available mathematical dataset to set a solid foundation for temporal reasoning. However, the in-depth study indicates that focusing solely on mathematical enhancement falls short of addressing pure temporal reasoning tasks. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a simple but effective self-critic temporal optimization method to enhance the model's temporal reasoning capabilities without sacrificing general task abilities. Finally, we develop Timo, a model designed to excel in temporal reasoning at the 7B and 13B scales. Notably, Timo outperforms the counterpart LLMs by 10.0 and 7.6 in average accuracy scores and achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of comparable size. Extensive experiments further validate our framework's effectiveness and its generalization across diverse temporal tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaochen0110/Timo."

Recently, efforts have been made to train language agents for performance improvement, with multi-step reasoning and action trajectories as the training data. However, collecting such trajectories still requires considerable human effort, by either artificial annotation or implementations of diverse prompting frameworks. In this work, we propose A$^\\mathbf{3}$T, a framework that enables the Autonomous Annotation of Agent Trajectories in the style of ReAct. The central role is an ActRe prompting agent, which explains the reason for an arbitrary action. When randomly sampling an external action, the ReAct-style agent could query the ActRe agent with the action to obtain its textual rationales. Novel trajectories are then synthesized by prepending the posterior reasoning from ActRe to the sampled action. In this way, the ReAct-style agent executes multiple trajectories for the failed tasks, and selects the successful ones to supplement its failed trajectory for contrastive self-training. Realized by policy gradient methods with binarized rewards, the contrastive self-training with accumulated trajectories facilitates a closed loop for multiple rounds of language agent self-improvement. We conduct experiments using QLoRA fine-tuning with the open-sourced Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2. In AlfWorld, the agent trained with A$^3$T obtains a 1-shot success rate of 96%, and 100% success with 4 iterative rounds.

Our extensive evaluations across a variety of commonsense reasoning and natural language processing tasks show that AdaMoLE exceeds baseline performance. This enhancement highlights the advantages of AdaMoLE's adaptive selection of LoRA experts, improving model effectiveness without a corresponding increase in the expert count.

The dominant approach for steering LLMs towards beneficial behavior is Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). This involves training a reward model with a human-labeled ranking dataset and fine-tuning the LLM with the reward signal using RL. Despite the fact that the reward is learned from comparing different responses, the RL stage doesn't involve direct comparisons. This inconsistency between reward learning and reinforcement learning stages exacerbates RL's instability. An example would be that the well adopted RL optimizer, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), could perform different gradient updates even for batches with identical human preference information. To address this, we propose a new framework, reinforcement learning with comparative feedback, and a simple policy gradient algorithm, Pairwise Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O), that learns to improve from direct comparison. Theoretically, P3O has the nice property of being invariant with any reward functions that contain identical preference information, while doesn't require learning a value function. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that P3O can align with human preferences better than existing methods. This suggest that comparative RL is strong candidate for aligning LLM with preference data."

To evaluate the ability of LLMs on code, both academic and industry practitioners rely on popular handcrafted benchmarks.

Further, due to popularity and age, many benchmarks are prone to data leakage where example solutions can be readily found on the web and thus potentially in training data. Such limitations inevitably lead us to inquire: Is the leaderboard performance on existing benchmarks reliable and comprehensive enough to measure the program synthesis ability of LLMs? To address this, we introduce EvoEval \u2013 a program synthesis benchmark suite created by evolving existing benchmarks into different targeted domains for a comprehensive evaluation of LLM coding abilities. Our study on 51 LLMs shows that compared to the high performance obtained on standard benchmarks like HumanEval, there is a significant drop in performance (on average 39.4%) when using EvoEval. Additionally, the decrease in performance can range from 19.6% to 47.7%, leading to drastic ranking changes amongst LLMs and showing potential overfitting of existing benchmarks. Furthermore, we showcase various insights including the brittleness of instruction-following models when encountering rewording or subtle changes as well as the importance of learning problem composition and decomposition. EvoEval not only provides comprehensive benchmarks, but can be used to further evolve arbitrary problems to keep up with advances and the ever-changing landscape of LLMs for code.

To this end, we present IllusionVQA: a diverse dataset of challenging optical illusions and hard-to-interpret scenes to test the capability of VLMs in two distinct multiple-choice VQA tasks - comprehension and soft localization. GPT4V, the best performing VLM, achieves 62.99% accuracy (4-shot) on the comprehension task and 49.7% on the localization task (4-shot and Chain-of-Thought).

However, extending these advancements to enable end-to-end speech-to-speech conversation bots remains a formidable challenge, primarily due to the extensive dataset and computational resources required. The conventional approach of cascading automatic speech recognition (ASR), LLM, and text-to-speech (TTS) models in a pipeline, while effective, suffers from unnatural prosody because it lacks direct interactions between the input audio and its transcribed text and the output audio. These systems are also limited by their inherent latency from the ASR process for real-time applications. This paper introduces Style-Talker, an innovative framework that fine-tunes an audio LLM alongside a style-based TTS model for fast spoken dialog generation. Style-Talker takes user input audio and uses transcribed chat history and speech styles to generate both the speaking style and text for the response. Subsequently, the TTS model synthesizes the speech, which is then played back to the user. While the response speech is being played, the input speech undergoes ASR processing to extract the transcription and speaking style, serving as the context for the ensuing dialogue turn. This novel pipeline accelerates the traditional cascade ASR-LLM-TTS systems while integrating rich paralinguistic information from input speech. Our experimental results show that Style-Talker significantly outperforms the conventional cascade and speech-to-speech baselines in terms of both dialogue naturalness and coherence while being more than 50% faster.

Compositional ability, solving unseen complex tasks that combine two or more simple tasks, is an essential reasoning ability for Artificial General Intelligence. Despite the tremendous success of LLMs, how they approach composite tasks, especially those not encountered during the pretraining phase, remains an open and largely underexplored question. In this study, we delve into the ICL capabilities of LLMs on composite tasks, with only simple tasks as in-context examples. We develop a test suite of composite tasks including linguistic and logical challenges and perform empirical studies across different LLM families. We observe that models exhibit divergent behaviors: (1) For simpler composite tasks that apply distinct mapping mechanisms to different input segments, the models demonstrate decent compositional ability, while scaling up the model enhances this ability; (2) for more complex composite tasks involving reasoning multiple steps, where each step represents one task, models typically underperform, and scaling up generally provides no improvements.

A recently proposed detoxification method utilizes the task vector obtained by subtraction from the fine-tuned model on toxic datasets to the pre-trained model. This approach has shown effectiveness for detoxification but still suffers from degradation. This study focuses on further mitigating degradation while maintaining detoxification performance. To mitigate the degradation, we propose a method that detoxifies the PLMs by fine-tuning multiple models on split toxic datasets and by merging the subtracted task vectors. We conducted experiments on two toxic datasets (Civil Comments and Toxigen) with five PLMs (GPT2-small, GPT2-medium, GPT2-large, Phi-1.5, and Llama2-7b), demonstrating that our method consistently achieves a lower toxicity score while preventing the degradation compared to baseline methods. Especially, with the GPT2-small model on the Toxigen dataset, degradation was reduced by 38.9% compared to that of an existing task vector method while maintaining a similar toxicity score. In addition, we found that merging multiple detoxified models tends to increase the number of parameters that remained almost unchanged from the pre-trained model. We assume that by merging multiple detoxified models, \"decoupling noise and toxic parameters\" is implicitly achieved. The accidental noise in the parameter shift unrelated to detoxification disappears by averaging noise, whereas the parameter shift associated with detoxification is maintained. We hope that the findings of this study will be applied not only to detoxification but also to many other research domains that seek to suppress undesirable outputs of language models."

        "abstract": "Chain-of-thought responses from language models improve performance across most benchmarks. However, it remains unclear to what extent these performance gains can be attributed to human-like task decomposition or simply the greater computation that additional tokens allow. We show that transformers can use meaningless filler tokens (e.g., \u2018......\u2019) in place of a chain of thought to solve two hard algorithmic tasks they could not solve when responding without intermediate tokens. However, we find empirically that learning to use filler tokens is difficult and requires specific, dense supervision to converge. We also provide a theoretical conjecture for the class of problems where filler tokens are useful in terms of the quantifier depth of a first-order formula. For problems satisfying this characterization, chain-of-thought tokens need not provide information about the intermediate computational steps involved in multi-token computations. In summary, our results show that additional tokens can provide computational benefits independent of token choice. The fact that intermediate tokens can act as filler tokens raises concerns about large language models engaging in unauditable, hidden computations that are increasingly detached from the observed chain-of-thought tokens."

This phenomenon has been studied extensively using reference games, showing properties of human language that go beyond relaying intents. It remains unexplored whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) similarly increase communication efficiency during interactions, and what mechanisms they may adopt for this purpose. We introduce ICCA, an automated framework to evaluate such conversational adaptation as an in-context behavior in MLLMs. We evaluate several state-of-the-art MLLMs, and observe that while they may understand the increasingly efficient language of their interlocutor, they do not spontaneously make their own language more efficient over time. This latter ability can only be elicited in some models (e.g., GPT-4) with heavy-handed prompting. This shows that this property of linguistic interaction does not arise from current training regimes, even though it is a common hallmark of human language."

Despite significant strides toward safety alignment, recent work GCG~\\citep{zou2023universal} proposes a discrete tokens optimization algorithm and selects the single suffix with the lowest loss to successfully jailbreak aligned LLMs. In this work, we first discuss the drawbacks of solely picking the suffix with the lowest loss during GCG optimization for jailbreaking and uncover the missed successful suffixes during the intermediate steps. Moreover, we utilize those successful suffixes as training data to learn a generative model, named AmpleGCG, which captures the distribution of adversarial suffixes given a harmful query and enables the rapid generation of hundreds of suffixes for any harmful queries in seconds. AmpleGCG achieves near 100% attack success rate (ASR) on two aligned LLMs (Llama-2-7B-chat and Vicuna-7B), surpassing two strongest attack baselines. More interestingly, AmpleGCG also transfers seamlessly to attack different models, including closed-source LLMs, achieving a 99% ASR on the latest GPT-3.5. To summarize, our work amplifies the impact of GCG by training a generative model of adversarial suffixes that is universal to any harmful queries and transferable from attacking open-source LLMs to closed-source LLMs. Impressively, it can generate 200 adversarial suffixes for one harmful query in only 4 seconds, rendering it more challenging to defend."

To perform speculative decoding, a small draft model proposes candidate continuations of the input sequence that are then verified in parallel by the base model. One way to specify the draft model, as used in the recent Medusa decoding framework, is as a collection of lightweight heads, called draft heads, that operate on the base model's hidden states. To date, all existing draft heads have been sequentially independent, meaning that they speculate tokens in the candidate continuation independently of any preceding tokens in the candidate continuation. In this work, we propose Hydra heads: a sequentially-dependent drop-in replacement for standard draft heads that significantly improves the accuracy of draft head speculation. We further explore the design space of Hydra head training objectives and architectures, and propose a carefully tuned Hydra head recipe, which we call Hydra++, that improves decoding throughput by up to 1.31x and 2.70x compared to Medusa decoding and autoregressive decoding respectively. Overall, Hydra heads are a simple and well-motivated intervention on standard draft heads that significantly improve the end-to-end speed of draft head-based speculative decoding.

We test these hypotheses by training language models without propagating gradients to past timesteps, a scheme we formalize as myopic training.

While benchmarks such as TruthfulQA emphasise factual accuracy or truthfulness, and others such as COPA explore plausible scenarios without explicitly incorporating world knowledge, PRobELM seeks to bridge this gap by evaluating models' capabilities to prioritise plausible scenarios that leverage world knowledge over less plausible alternatives. This design allows us to assess the potential of language models for downstream use cases such as literature-based discovery where the focus is on identifying information that is likely but not yet known. Our benchmark is constructed from a dataset curated from Wikidata edit histories, tailored to align the temporal bounds of the training data for the evaluated models. PRobELM facilitates the evaluation of language models across multiple prompting types, including statement, text completion, and question-answering. Experiments with 10 models of various sizes and architectures on the relationship between model scales, training recency, and plausibility performance, reveal that factual accuracy does not directly correlate with plausibility performance and that up-to-date training data enhances plausibility assessment across different model architectures."

Due to their world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, LLM agents achieve stronger performance than previous smaller agents based on reinforcement learning (RL); however, frequently calling LLMs is slow and expensive. This begs an interesting question: Instead of directly employing LLMs as embodied agents, can we use LLMs\u2019 reasoning capabilities to adaptively create training environments to help smaller embodied RL agents learn useful skills that they are weak at? In this work, we propose EnvGen, a novel framework to address this question. First, we prompt an LLM to generate training environments that allow agents to quickly learn different tasks in parallel. Concretely, the LLM is given the task description and environment simulator objectives that the agents should learn and is then asked to generate a set of environment configurations (e.g., different terrains, items initially given to agents, chances of finding certain objects, etc.). Next, we train a small RL agent in a mixture of the original and LLM-generated environments. Then, we enable the LLM to continuously adapt the generated environments to progressively improve the skills that the agent is weak at, by providing feedback to the LLM in the form of the agent\u2019s performance. We demonstrate the usefulness of EnvGen with comprehensive experiments in Crafter and Heist game environments. We find that a small RL agent trained with EnvGen can outperform SOTA methods, including a GPT-4 agent, and learns long-horizon tasks significantly faster. We also show that using an LLM to adapt environments dynamically outperforms curriculum learning approaches and how the LLM adapts training environments to help improve RL agents\u2019 weaker skills over time. Additionally, EnvGen is substantially more efficient as it only uses a small number of LLM calls (e.g., 4 in total), whereas LLM agents require one or more LLM calls per step (resulting in thousands of LLM calls per episode).

In this paper, we propose VideoDirectorGPT, a novel framework for consistent multi-scene video generation that uses the knowledge of LLMs for video content planning and grounded video generation.

Next, guided by this video plan, our video generator, named Layout2Vid, has explicit control over spatial layouts and can maintain temporal consistency of entities across multiple scenes, while being trained only with image-level annotations. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed VideoDirectorGPT framework substantially improves layout and movement control in both single- and multi-scene video generation and can generate multi-scene videos with consistency, while achieving competitive performance with SOTAs in open-domain single-scene T2V generation. Detailed ablation studies, including dynamic adjustment of layout control strength with an LLM and video generation with user-provided images, confirm the effectiveness of each component of our framework and its future potential."

Across a range of data-to-text and question-answering exper- iments, we find that LLMs are able to directly output text that makes use of accurate symbolic references while maintaining fluency and factuality.

Participants ($N=419$) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Results indicate that humans rank content as truthful in the order genuine > minor hallucination > major hallucination and user engagement behaviors mirror this pattern.

When choosing the best prompt demonstrations across six quantized language models applied to 16 BIG-bench Lite tasks, more than 20% of the few-shot results that exceed the standard baseline do not exceed this stronger random baseline.

        "abstract": "Current Large Language Models (LLMs), even those tuned for safety and alignment, are susceptible to jailbreaking. Some have found that just further fine-tuning an aligned model with benign data (i.e., data without harmful content) surprisingly leads to substantial degradation in safety. We delve into the data-centric aspects of why benign fine-tuning inadvertently contributes to jailbreaking. First, we represent fine-tuning data through two lenses: representation and gradient spaces. Additionally, we propose a bi-directional anchoring method that, during the selection process, prioritizes data points that are close to harmful examples and far from benign ones. Our approach effectively identifies subsets of benign data that are more likely to degrade the model's safety after fine-tuning. Training on just 100 of these seemingly benign datapoints surprisingly leads to the fine-tuned model affirmatively responding to >70% of tested harmful requests, compared to <20% after fine-tuning on randomly selected data. We also observe that the selected data frequently appear as lists, bullet points, or math questions, indicating a systematic pattern in fine-tuning data that contributes to jailbreaking."

        "abstract": "Neural network models have achieved high performance on a wide variety of complex tasks, but the algorithms that they implement are notoriously difficult to interpret. It is often necessary to hypothesize intermediate variables involved in a network\u2019s computation in order to understand these algorithms. For example, does a language model depend on particular syntactic properties when generating a sentence? Yet, existing analysis tools make it difficult to test hypotheses of this type. We propose a new analysis technique \u2013 circuit probing \u2013 that automatically uncovers low-level circuits that compute hypothesized intermediate variables. This enables causal analysis through targeted ablation at the level of model parameters. We apply this method to models trained on simple arithmetic tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness at (1) deciphering the algorithms that models have learned, (2) revealing modular structure within a model, and (3) tracking the development of circuits over training. Across these three experiments we demonstrate that circuit probing combines and extends the capabilities of existing methods, providing one unified approach for a variety of analyses. Finally, we demonstrate circuit probing on a real-world use case: uncovering circuits that are responsible for subject-verb agreement and reflexive anaphora in GPT2-Small and Medium."

However, despite the revolutionizing prospect of MLLMs, our understanding of their reasoning abilities is limited. In this study, we assess the nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities of open-source and closed-source MLLMs using variations of Raven's Progressive Matrices. Our experiments reveal the challenging nature of such problems for MLLMs while showcasing the immense gap between open-source and closed-source models. We also uncover critical shortcomings of visual and textual perceptions, subjecting the models to low-performance ceilings. Finally, to improve MLLMs' performance, we experiment with different methods, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting, leading to a significant (up to 100%) boost in performance."

However, the significance of opinion leadership exhibited by LLM-based agents has been largely overlooked, which is crucial for practical applications in multi-agent and human-AI interaction settings. Opinion leaders are individuals who have a noticeable impact on the beliefs and behaviors of others within a social group. In this work, we employ the Werewolf game as a simulation platform to assess the opinion leadership of LLMs. The game includes the role of the Sheriff, tasked with summarizing arguments and recommending decision options, and therefore serves as a credible proxy for an opinion leader. We develop a framework integrating the Sheriff role and devise two novel metrics based on the critical characteristics of opinion leaders. The first metric measures the reliability of the opinion leader, and the second assesses the influence of the opinion leader on other players' decisions. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate LLMs of different scales. In addition, we collect a Werewolf question-answering dataset (WWQA) to assess and enhance LLM's grasp of the game rules, and we also incorporate human participants for further analysis. The results suggest that the Werewolf game is a suitable test bed to evaluate the opinion leadership of LLMs, and few LLMs possess the capacity for opinion leadership."

We extend this work into the more complex domain of chess, training on real games and investigating our model's internal representations using linear probes and contrastive activations. The model is given no a priori knowledge of the game and is solely trained on next character prediction, yet we find evidence of internal representations of board state. We validate these internal representations by using them to make interventions on the model's activations and edit its internal board state. Unlike Li et al's prior synthetic dataset approach, our analysis finds that the model also learns to estimate latent variables like player skill to better predict the next character.

A common practice is to label data via consensus annotation over human judgments. However, annotators' judgments for subjective tasks can differ in many ways: they may reflect different qualitative judgments about an example, and they may be mapped to a labeling scheme in different ways. We show that these nuances can be captured by natural language explanations, and propose a method to rescale ordinal annotations and explanations using LLMs. Specifically, we feed annotators' Likert ratings and corresponding explanations into an LLM and prompt it to produce a numeric score anchored in a scoring rubric. These scores should reflect the annotators' underlying assessments of the example. The rubric can be designed or modified after annotation, and include distinctions that may not have been known when the original error taxonomy was devised. We explore our technique in the context of rating system outputs for a document-grounded question answering task, where LLMs achieve near-human performance. Our method rescales the raw judgments without impacting agreement and brings the scores closer to human judgments grounded in the same scoring rubric."

To achieve better reasoning with MLLMs, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely explored, which further promotes MLLMs\u2019 explainability by giving intermediate reasoning steps. Despite the strong power demonstrated by MLLMs in multimodal reasoning, recent studies show that MLLMs still suffer from ad- versarial images. This raises the following open questions: Does CoT also enhance the adversarial robustness of MLLMs? What do the intermediate reasoning steps of CoT entail under adversarial attacks? To answer these questions, we first generalize existing attacks to CoT-based inferences by attacking the two main components, i.e., rationale and answer. We find that CoT indeed improves MLLMs\u2019 adversarial robustness against the existing attack methods by leveraging the multi-step reasoning process, but not substantially. Based on our findings, we further propose a novel attack method, termed as stop-reasoning attack, that attacks the model while by- passing the CoT reasoning process.

In this work, we address this concern for tabular data. Specifically, we introduce a variety of different techniques to assess whether a language model has seen a tabular dataset during training. This investigation reveals that LLMs have memorized many popular tabular datasets verbatim. We then compare the few-shot learning performance of LLMs on datasets that were seen during training to the performance on datasets released after training. We find that LLMs perform better on datasets seen during training, indicating that memorization leads to overfitting. At the same time, LLMs show non-trivial performance on novel datasets and are surprisingly robust to data transformations. We then investigate the in-context statistical learning abilities of LLMs. While LLMs are significantly better than random at solving statistical classification problems, the sample efficiency of few-shot learning lags behind traditional statistical learning algorithms, especially as the dimension of the problem increases. This suggests that much of the observed few-shot performance on novel real-world datasets is due to the LLM's world knowledge. Overall, our results highlight the importance of testing whether an LLM has seen an evaluation dataset during pre-training.

Implementing a pipeline solution with these two stages not only introduces complexities (necessitating dual meticulous tuning) but also leads to two occurrences of data distribution shifts, exacerbating catastrophic forgetting. To mitigate these, we propose a one-stage domain adaption protocol where heterogeneous data from both the traditional pre-training and supervised stages are unified into a simple instruction-output pair format to achieve efficient knowledge injection. Subsequently, a data priority sampling strategy is introduced to adaptively adjust data mixture during training. Following this protocol, we train HuatuoGPT-II, a specialized LLM for the medical domain in Chinese.

Previous work has explored generating task-specific data from state-of-the-art LLMs and using this data to finetune smaller models, but this approach requires access to a language model other than the one being trained, which introduces cost, scalability challenges, and legal hurdles associated with continuously relying on more powerful LLMs. In response to these, we propose Self-Guide, a multi-stage mechanism in which we synthesize task-specific input-output pairs from the student LLM, then use these input-output pairs to finetune the student LLM itself. In our empirical evaluation of the Natural Instructions V2 benchmark, we find that Self-Guide improves the performance of LLM by a substantial margin. Specifically, we report an absolute improvement of approximately 15% for classification tasks and 18% for generation tasks in the benchmark's metrics.

Our experimental evaluations across Robotic Planning and Alfworld environments reveal that after learning on a few training task instances, our approach to open-action learning markedly improves agent performance for the type of task (by 32 percent in AlfWorld compared to ReAct+Reflexion, for instance) highlighting the importance of experiential action learning in the development of more intelligent LLM agents."

        "abstract": "Multi-hop question answering (MQA) under knowledge editing (KE) has garnered significant attention in the era of large language models. However, existing models for MQA under KE exhibit poor performance when dealing with questions containing explicit temporal contexts. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, namely TEMPoral knowLEdge augmented Multi-hop Question Answering (TEMPLE-MQA). Unlike previous methods, TEMPLE-MQA first constructs a time-aware graph (TAG) to store edit knowledge in a structured manner. Then, through our proposed inference path, structural retrieval, and joint reasoning stages, TEMPLE-MQA effectively discerns temporal contexts within the question query. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TEMPLE-MQA significantly outperforms baseline models. Additionally, we contribute a new dataset, namely TKEMQA, which serves as the inaugural benchmark tailored specifically for MQA with temporal scopes."

This work focuses on evaluating LLMs in a Chinese context, specifically, for Traditional Chinese which has been largely underrepresented in existing benchmarks. We present TMLU, a comprehensive evaluation suit tailored for assessing the advanced knowledge and reasoning capability in LLMs, under the context of Taiwanese Mandarin. TMLU consists of an array of 37 subjects across social science, STEM, humanities, Taiwan-specific content, and others, ranging from middle school to professional levels. In addition, we curate chain-of-thought-like few-shot explanations for each subject to facilitate the evaluation of complex reasoning skills. To establish a comprehensive baseline, we conduct extensive experiments and analysis on 24 advanced LLMs. The results suggest that Chinese open-weight models demonstrate inferior performance comparing to multilingual proprietary ones, and open-weight models tailored for Taiwanese Mandarin lag behind the Simplified-Chinese counterparts. The findings indicate great headrooms for improvement, and emphasize the goal of TMLU to foster the development of localized Taiwanese-Mandarin LLMs. We release the benchmark and evaluation scripts for the community to promote future research."

        "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates many problems of fully parametric language models, such as temporal degradation, hallucinations, and lack of grounding. In RAG, the model\u2019s knowledge can be updated from documents provided in context. This leads to cases of conflict between the model\u2019s parametric knowledge and the contextual information, where the model may not always update its knowledge. Previous work studied context-memory knowledge conflicts by creating synthetic documents that contradict the model\u2019s correct parametric answers. We present a framework for studying such knowledge conflicts in a realistic setup. We update incorrect parametric knowledge using real conflicting documents. This reflects how knowledge conflicts arise in practice. In this realistic scenario, we find that knowledge updates fail less often than previously reported. In cases where the models still fail to update their answers, we find a parametric bias: the incorrect parametric answer appearing in context makes the knowledge update likelier to fail. These results suggest that the factual parametric knowledge of LLMs can negatively influence their reading abilities and behaviors.

We push all detectors to their limits, using the Real or Fake text benchmark that contains short texts on several topics and includes generations of various language models. We use this diversity to deeply examine the robustness of all detectors in cross-domain and cross-model settings to provide baselines and insights for future research. In particular, we find that perplexity-based approaches to boundary detection tend to be more robust to peculiarities of domain-specific data than supervised fine-tuning of the RoBERTa model; we also find which features of the text confuse boundary detection algorithms and negatively influence their performance in cross-domain settings."

Such information is crucial for applications where the LLM must provide up-to-date information. However, a reported cutoff only scratches the surface. Do all sub-resources in the training data share the same cutoff? Does the model's demonstrated knowledge for these sub-resources closely align to their cutoff? We define the notion of an effective cutoff, which is distinct from the LLM's reported cutoff and differs between sub-resources. We propose a simple approach to estimate effective cutoffs of an LLM on the resource-level by probing across versions of the data. Crucially, our method does not require access to a model's pre-training data. Through our analysis, we find that effective cutoffs often drastically differ from reported cutoffs. To understand the root cause of this observation, we conduct a large-scale analysis on open pre-training datasets. Our analysis reveals two reasons for these inconsistencies: (1) temporal misalignments of CommonCrawl data due to non-trivial amounts of old data in new dumps; and (2) complications in LLM deduplication schemes involving semantic duplicates and lexical near-duplicates. Overall, our results show that cutoffs are not as simple as they have seemed and that care must be taken both by LLM dataset curators as well as practitioners who seek to use these models."

However, key-value (KV) cache, which is stored to avoid re-computation, has emerged as a critical bottleneck by growing linearly in size with the sequence length. Due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, the entire KV cache will be loaded for every generated token, resulting in low utilization of computational cores and high latency. While various compression methods for KV cache have been proposed to alleviate this issue, they suffer from degradation in generation quality. We introduce TriForce, a hierarchical speculative decoding system that is scalable for long sequence generation. This approach leverages the original model weights and dynamic sparse KV cache via retrieval as a draft model, which serves as an intermediate layer in the hierarchy and is further speculated by a smaller model to reduce its drafting latency. TriForce not only facilitates impressive speedups for Llama2-7B-128K, achieving up to 2.31$\\times$ on an A100 GPU but also showcases scalability in handling even longer contexts. For the offloading setting on two RTX 4090 GPUs, TriForce achieves 0.108s/token\u2014only half as slow as the auto-regressive baseline on an A100, which attains 7.78$\\times$ on our optimized offloading system.

These tags, marked with alphanumerics, can be indexed via text tokens for easy reference. Despite the extraordinary performance from GPT-4V, we observe that other Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle to understand these visual tags. To promote the learning of SoM prompting for open-source models, we propose a new learning paradigm: list items one by one, which asks the model to enumerate and describe all visual tags placed on the image following the alphanumeric order of tags. By integrating our synthetic dataset with other visual instruction tuning datasets, we are able to equip existing MLLMs with the SoM prompting ability. Furthermore, we evaluate our finetuned SoM models on seven MLLM benchmarks. We find that this new dataset, even in a relatively small size (10k-30k images with tags), significantly enhances visual reasoning capabilities and reduces hallucinations for MLLMs. Perhaps surprisingly, these improvements persist even when the visual tags are omitted from input images during inference. This suggests the potential of ``list items one by one'' as a new paradigm for training MLLMs, which strengthens the object-text alignment through the use of visual tags in the training stage. Finally, we conduct analyses by probing trained models to understand the working mechanism of SoM. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/zzxslp/SoM-LLaVA."

While increasingly ubiquitous dependence on such large-scale language models is convenient, there remains an important question of whether small-scale models could have achieved competitive results, if we were to seek an alternative learning method---that allows for a more cost-efficient, controllable, yet powerful summarizer. We present InfoSumm, a novel framework to distill a powerful summarizer based on the information-theoretic objective for summarization, without relying on either the LLM's capability or human-written references. To achieve this, we first propose a novel formulation of the desiderata of summarization (saliency, faithfulness and brevity) through the lens of mutual information between the original document and the summary. Based on this formulation, we start off from Pythia-2.8B as the teacher model, which is not yet capable of summarization, then self-train the model to optimize for the information-centric measures of ideal summaries. Distilling from the improved teacher, we arrive at a compact but powerful summarizer with only 568M parameters that performs competitively against ChatGPT, without ever relying on ChatGPT's capabilities. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our approach outperforms in-domain supervised models in human evaluation, let alone state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and wins over ChatGPT in controllable summarization."

Preference-based alignment is a widely used paradigm for this purpose, in which preferences over generation pairs are first elicited from human annotators or AI systems, and then fed into some alignment techniques, e.g., Direct Preference Optimization. However, a substantial percent (up to 42%) of the preference pairs used in GLM alignment are noisy, and it remains unclear how the noise affect the alignment performance and how to mitigate their negative impact. In this paper, we propose a framework to inject desirable amounts and types of noise to the preferences, and systematically study the impact of preference noise on the alignment performance in two tasks (summarization and dialogue generation). We find that the alignment performance can be highly sensitive to the noise rates in the preference data: e.g., a 10 percentage points (pp) increase of the noise rate can lead to 30 pp drop in the alignment performance (in win rate). To mitigate the impact of noise, confidence-based data filtering shows significant benefit when certain types of noise are present. We hope our work can help the community better understand and mitigate the impact of preference noise in GLM alignment."

Recently, deep learning-based methods have shown promise in modeling the spatial-temporal relationships for predicting environmental variables. However, these approaches often fall short in handling incomplete features and distribution shifts, which are commonly observed in environmental data due to the substantial cost of data collection and malfunctions in measuring instruments. To address these issues, we propose LITE -- a multimodal large language model for environmental ecosystems modeling. Specifically, LITE unifies different environmental variables by transforming them into natural language descriptions and line graph images. Then, LITE utilizes unified encoders to capture spatial-temporal dynamics and correlations in different modalities. During this step, the incomplete features are imputed by a sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework, and the distribution shift is handled by incorporating multi-granularity information from past observations. Finally, guided by domain instructions, a language model is employed to fuse the multimodal representations for the prediction. Our experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly enhances performance in environmental spatial-temporal prediction across different domains compared to the best baseline, with a 41.25% reduction in prediction error.

Our findings reveal that the repeated use of smaller models can yield consistent improvements, with gains of up to 15% across five tasks.

This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of studies that go beyond task accuracy, offering deeper insights into the models' reasoning processes. Furthermore, we survey prevalent methodologies to evaluate the reasoning behavior of LLMs, emphasizing current trends and efforts towards more nuanced reasoning analyses. Our review suggests that LLMs tend to rely on surface-level patterns and correlations in their training data, rather than on sophisticated reasoning abilities.

To deal with the scarcity of labeled data, transfer learning is a conventional approach; it suggests to learn a transferable knowledge by training a neural network from multiple other sources. In this paper, we investigate transfer learning of tabular tasks, which has been less studied and successful in the literature, compared to other domains, e.g., vision and language. This is because tables are inherently heterogeneous, i.e., they contain different columns and feature spaces, making transfer learning difficult. On the other hand, recent advances in natural language processing suggest that the label scarcity issue can be mitigated by utilizing in-context learning capability of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this and the fact that LLMs can also process tables within a unified language space, we ask whether LLMs can be effective for tabular transfer learning, in particular, under the scenarios where the source and target datasets are of different format. As a positive answer, we propose a novel tabular transfer learning framework, coined Prompt to Transfer (P2T), that utilizes unlabeled (or heterogeneous) source data with LLMs. Specifically, P2T identifies a column feature in a source dataset that is strongly correlated with a target task feature to create examples relevant to the target task, thus creating pseudo-demonstrations for prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that P2T outperforms previous methods on various tabular learning benchmarks, showing good promise for the important, yet underexplored tabular transfer learning problem.

Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the robustness of text answers. We show that the text answers are more robust to question perturbations than the first token probabilities, when the first token answers mismatch the text answers. The difference in robustness increases as the mismatch rate becomes greater. As the mismatch reaches over 50%, the text answer is more robust to option order changes than the debiased first token probabilities using state-of-the-art debiasing methods such as PriDe.

        "abstract": "Efficiently training large language models requires parallelizing across hundreds of hardware accelerators and invoking various compute and memory optimizations.\nWhen combined, many of these strategies have complex interactions regarding the final training efficiency. Prior work tackling this problem did not have access to the latest set of optimizations, such as FlashAttention or sequence parallelism. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study of possible training configurations for large language models. We distill this large study into several key recommendations for the most efficient training. For instance, we find that using a micro-batch size of 1 usually enables the most efficient training layouts. Larger micro-batch sizes necessitate activation checkpointing or higher degrees of model parallelism and also lead to larger pipeline bubbles. Our most efficient configurations enable us to achieve state-of-the-art training efficiency results over a range of model sizes, most notably a Model FLOPs utilization of 70.5% when training a LLaMA 13B model."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various tasks, yet they still exhibit limitations such as hallucination, unfaithful reasoning, and toxic content. One potential approach to mitigate these issues is learning from human or external feedback (e.g. tools). In this paper, we introduce an intrinsic self-correct reasoning framework for LLMs that eliminates the need for human feedback, external tools, and handcraft prompts. The proposed framework, based on a multi-step reasoning paradigm \\textbf{Le}arning from \\textbf{Co}rrectness (\\textsc{LeCo}), improves reasoning performance without needing to learn from errors. This paradigm prioritizes learning from correct reasoning steps, and a unique method to measure confidence for each reasoning step based on generation logits. Experimental results across various multi-step reasoning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in improving reasoning performance with reduced token consumption."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, there is a concern that they can be misused for malicious purposes, such as fraud or denial-of-service attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods for detecting whether the party involved in a conversation is a bot or a human. In this paper, we propose a framework named FLAIR, Finding Large Language Model Authenticity via a Single Inquiry and Response, to detect conversational bots in an online manner. Specifically, we target a single question scenario that can effectively differentiate human users from bots. The questions are divided into two categories: those that are easy for humans but difficult for bots (e.g., counting, substitution, searching, and ASCII art reasoning), and those that are easy for bots but difficult for humans (e.g., memorization and computation). Our approach shows different strengths of these questions in their effectiveness, providing a new way for online service providers to protect themselves against nefarious activities. Our code and question set are available at https://github.com/hongwang600/FLAIR."

To further ELK research, we introduce 12 datasets and a corresponding suite of \"quirky\" language models (LMs) that are finetuned to make systematic errors when answering questions if and only if the keyword \"Bob\" is present in the prompt. We find that, especially in middle layers, linear probes usually report an LM's knowledge independently of what the LM outputs, enabling us to elicit the correct answer despite the model's untruthful output. The best probing method (logistic regression on contrast pairs) recovers 89% of the gap in AUROC between truthful and untruthful contexts, and 75% for questions harder than those used to train the probe. We also find that a mechanistic anomaly detection approach can flag untruthful behavior with 0.95 AUROC. Our results show promise for eliciting reliable knowledge from capable but untrusted models, and facilitates future research empirically investigating ELK methods."

These include synthesizing code from natural language, synthesizing tests from code, and synthesizing explanations of code. In contrast, the behavior of instructional code editing with LLMs is understudied. These are tasks in which the model is provided a block of code and an instruction to modify the code. The editing instruction may ask for a feature to be added or removed, describe a bug and ask for a fix, or ask for a different kind of solution. We introduce a carefully crafted benchmark of code editing tasks and use it to evaluate several cutting edge LLMs. Our evaluation exposes a significant gap between the capabilities of state-of-the-art open and closed models. For example, even GPT-3.5-Turbo is better than the best open model at code editing tasks. We also introduce a new, carefully curated, permissively licensed training dataset of code editing tasks coupled with natural language instructions.

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising tool to revolutionize knowledge interaction and potentially accelerate biomedical discovery. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs as biomedical hypothesis generators. We construct a dataset of background-hypothesis pairs from biomedical literature, carefully partitioned into training, seen, and unseen test sets based on publication date to mitigate data contamination. Using this dataset, we assess the hypothesis generation capabilities of top-tier instructed models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings. To enhance the exploration of uncertainty, a crucial aspect of scientific discovery, we incorporate tool use and multi-agent interactions in our evaluation framework. Furthermore, we propose four novel metrics grounded in extensive literature review to evaluate the quality of generated hypotheses, considering both LLM-based and human assessments. Our experiments yield two key findings: 1) LLMs can generate novel and validated hypotheses, even when tested on literature unseen during training, and 2) Increasing uncertainty through multi-agent interactions and tool use can facilitate diverse candidate generation and improve zero-shot hypothesis generation performance. However, we also observe that the integration of additional knowledge through few-shot learning and tool use may not always lead to performance gains, highlighting the need for careful consideration of the type and scope of external knowledge incorporated. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs as powerful aids in biomedical hypothesis generation and provide valuable insights to guide further research in this area."

However, due to the inherent flaws of current retrieval systems, there might exist irrelevant information within those retrieving top-ranked passages. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation into the robustness of LLMs to different types of irrelevant information under various conditions. We initially introduce a framework to construct high-quality irrelevant information that ranges from semantically unrelated, partially related, and related to questions. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the constructed irrelevant information not only scores highly on similarity metrics, being highly retrieved by existing systems, but also bears semantic connections to the context. Our investigation reveals that current LLMs still face challenges in discriminating highly semantically related information and can be easily distracted by these irrelevant yet misleading content. Besides, we also find that current solutions for handling irrelevant information have limitations in improving the robustness of LLMs to such distractions. All the resources are available on GitHub."

In this paper, we introduce VisualWebBench, a multimodal benchmark designed to assess the capabilities of MLLMs across a variety of web tasks. VisualWebBench consists of seven tasks, and comprises 1.5K human-curated instances from 139 real websites, covering 87 sub-domains.

        "abstract": "When writing and talking, people sometimes pause to think. Although reasoning-focused works have often framed reasoning as a method of answering questions or completing agentic tasks, reasoning is implicit in almost all written text. For example, this applies to the steps not stated between the lines of a proof or to the theory of mind underlying a conversation. In the Self-Taught Reasoner (STaR, Zelikman et al. 2022), useful thinking is learned by inferring rationales from few-shot examples in question-answering and learning from those that lead to a correct answer. This is a highly constrained setting -- ideally, a language model could instead learn to infer unstated rationales in arbitrary text. We present Quiet-STaR, a generalization of STaR in which LMs learn to generate rationales at each token to explain future text, improving their predictions. We address key challenges, including 1) the computational cost of generating continuations, 2) the fact that the LM does not initially know how to generate or use internal thoughts, and 3) the need to predict beyond individual next tokens. To resolve these, we propose a tokenwise parallel sampling algorithm, using learnable tokens indicating a thought's start and end, and an extended teacher-forcing technique. Encouragingly, generated rationales disproportionately help model difficult-to-predict tokens and improve the LM's ability to directly answer difficult questions. In particular, after continued pretraining of an LM on a corpus of internet text with Quiet-STaR, we find zero-shot improvements on GSM8K (5.9%\u219210.9%) and CommonsenseQA (36.3%\u219247.2%) and observe a perplexity improvement of difficult tokens in natural text. Crucially, these improvements require no fine-tuning on these tasks. Quiet-STaR marks a step towards LMs that can learn to reason in a more general and scalable way."

However, their next-token-prediction objective arguably limits their performance in scenarios that require planning, such as writing a coherent article. In this paper, we train a module for planning the future writing process via a self-supervised learning objective. Given the textual context, this planning module learns to predict future abstract writing actions, which correspond to centroids in a clustered text embedding space. By conditioning on these actions, our model extends the successful language model formula to more abstract planning in an unsupervised way. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method improves language modeling performance in general, particularly with respect to the text structure. Because our framework uses a planner module that is unsupervised and external to the language model, new planner modules can be trained at large scale and easily be shared with the community."

With the aim of rigorously understanding model collapse in language models, we consider in this paper a statistical model that allows us to characterize the impact of various recursive training scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that model collapse cannot be avoided when training solely on synthetic data. However, when mixing both real and synthetic data, we provide an estimate of a maximal amount of synthetic data below which model collapse can eventually be avoided.

The task is question-answering: for each maze, a large language model reads the walkthrough and answers hundreds of mapping and navigation questions such as \"How should you go to Attic from West of House?\" and \"Where are we if we go north and east from Cellar?\". Although these questions are easy to humans, it turns out that even GPT-4, the best-to-date language model, performs poorly at answering them. Further, our experiments suggest that a strong mapping and navigation ability would benefit large language models in performing relevant downstream tasks, such as playing textgames.

We treat philosophy as a case study in critical thinking, and interview 21 professional philosophers about how they engage in critical thinking and on their experiences with LMs. We find that philosophers do not find LMs to be useful because they lack a sense of selfhood (memory, beliefs, consistency) and initiative (curiosity, proactivity). We propose the selfhood-initiative model for critical thinking tools to characterize this gap. Using the model, we formulate three roles LMs could play as critical thinking tools: the Interlocutor, the Monitor, and the Respondent. We hope that our work inspires LM researchers to further develop LMs as critical thinking tools and philosophers and other `critical thinkers' to imagine intellectually substantive uses of LMs."

Traditional coding benchmarks often fail to provide reliable insights into code efficiency, due to their reliance on simplistic test inputs and the absence of effective compound metrics. DPE addresses these issues by focusing on efficiency-demanding programming tasks and establishing an insightful compound metric for performance evaluation. DPE operates in two phases: To curate efficiency datasets, it selects efficiency-demanding tasks from existing coding benchmarks and generates computationally expensive inputs to stress the efficiency of LLM solutions. To assess the code efficiency, DPE profiles the new solution and compares it globally against a set of reference solutions that exhibit distinct efficiency levels, where the matched level defines its efficiency score. As a proof of concept, we use DPE to create EvalPerf, a benchmark with 121 performance-challenging coding tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation draws interesting findings on the efficiency impact of model sizes, instruction tuning, and prompting. For example, while the scaling law fails to account for code efficiency, general instruction tuning benefits both code correctness and efficiency. We also evaluate the evaluation by examining the effectiveness of DPE, showing that EvalPerf is reliable and convenient to use even across platforms."

Powered by LLMs, our Agent-Driver is endowed with intuitive common sense and robust reasoning capabilities, thus enabling a more nuanced, human-like approach to autonomous driving.

This approach allows for better characterization of the joint analysis on the robustness and accuracy of LMs without risking sensitive information leakage. It also provides a more controlled and private way to evaluate LMs that avoids overfitting specific test sets.

We introduce proxy-tuning, a lightweight decoding-time algorithm that operates on top of black-box LMs to achieve the same end as direct tuning, but by accessing only its predictions over the output vocabulary, not its parameters. Our method tunes a smaller LM, then applies the difference between the predictions of the small tuned and untuned LMs to shift the original predictions of the larger untuned model in the direction of tuning, while retaining the benefits of larger-scale pretraining. In experiments, when we apply proxy-tuning to Llama2-70B using proxies of only 7B size, we can close 88% of the gap between Llama2-70B and its truly-tuned chat version, when evaluated across knowledge, reasoning, and safety benchmarks. We then demonstrate the generality of proxy-tuning by applying it to domain adaptation on code, and task-specific finetuning on question-answering and math problems. Finally, we show how to proxy-tune a truly black-box LM, GPT-3.5, for temporal adaptation, increasing its knowledge about recent events.

The basic building block in AgentKit is a node, containing a natural language prompt for a specific subtask. The user then puts together chains of nodes, in order to build a \"thought process\" for any problem, like stacking LEGO pieces. The chains of nodes can be designed to explicitly enforce a naturally structured \"thought process\". For example, for the task of writing a paper, one may start with the thought process of 1) identify a core message, 2) identify prior research gaps, etc. The nodes in AgentKit can be designed and combined in different ways to implement multiple advanced capabilities including on-the-fly hierarchical planning, reflection, and learning from interactions. In addition, due to the modular nature and the intuitive design to simulate explicit human thought process, a basic agent could be implemented as simple as a list of prompts for the subtasks and therefore could be designed and tuned by someone without any programming experience. Quantitatively, we show that agents designed through AgentKit achieve SOTA performance on Webshop and Crafter.

However, existing works can only analyze standard texts from mainstream cyber threat knowledge bases such as CVE and NVD, and lack of the capability to link multiple CTI articles to uncover the relationships among security-related entities such as vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, CTIKG, that utilizes prompt engineering to efficiently build a security-oriented knowledge graph from CTI articles based on LLMs. To mitigate the challenges of LLMs in randomness, hallucinations and tokens limitation, CTIKG divides an article into segments and employs multiple LLM agents with dual memory design to (1) process each text segment separately and (2) summarize the results of the text segments to generate more accurate results. We evaluate CTIKG on two representative benchmarks built from real world CTI articles, and the results show that CTIKG achieves 86.88% precision in building security-oriented knowledge graphs, achieving at least 30% improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques.

To uncover the impacts systematically, we construct parametric knowledge graphs to reveal different LLM knowledge structures, and introduce external information through external knowledge distractors of varying degrees, methods, positions, and formats. Experiments on both closed and open-source models demonstrate that LLMs tend to believe in external knowledge sources, particularly when they direct conflict or make confounding changes within detailed contexts. We also discover while LLMs are sensitive to external knowledge veracity, they still get distracted by unrelated information.

Second, existing $n$-gram LMs use small $n$ which hinders their performance; we instead allow $n$ to be arbitrarily large, by introducing a new $\\infty$-gram LM with backoff. Instead of pre-computing $n$-gram count tables (which would be very expensive), we develop an engine named infini-gram -- powered by suffix arrays -- that can compute $\\infty$-gram (as well as $n$-gram with arbitrary $n$) probabilities with millisecond-level latency. The $\\infty$-gram framework and infini-gram engine enable us to conduct many novel and interesting analyses of human-written and machine-generated text: we find that the $\\infty$-gram LM has fairly high accuracy for next-token prediction (47%), and can complement neural LLMs to greatly reduce their perplexity. When analyzing machine-generated text, we also observe irregularities in the machine: $\\infty$-gram agreement level with respect to the suffix length, which indicates deficiencies in neural LLM pretraining and the positional embeddings of Transformers."

        "title": "ProLLM: Protein Chain-of-Thoughts Enhanced LLM for Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction",
        "abstract": "The prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial for understanding biological functions and diseases. Previous machine learning approaches to PPI prediction mainly focus on direct physical interactions, ignoring the broader context of nonphysical connections through intermediate proteins, thus limiting their effectiveness. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides a new opportunity for addressing this complex biological challenge. By transforming structured data into natural language prompts, we can map the relationships between proteins into texts. This approach allows LLMs to identify indirect connections between proteins, tracing the path from upstream to downstream. Therefore, we propose a novel framework ProLLM that employs an LLM tailored for PPI for the first time. Specifically, we propose Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT), which replicates the biological mechanism of signaling pathways as natural language prompts. ProCoT considers a signaling pathway as a protein reasoning process, which starts from upstream proteins and passes through several intermediate proteins to transmit biological signals to downstream proteins. Thus, we can use ProCoT to predict the interaction between upstream proteins and downstream proteins. The training of ProLLM employs the ProCoT format, which enhances the model's understanding of complex biological problems. In addition to ProCoT, this paper also contributes to the exploration of embedding replacement of protein sites in natural language prompts, and instruction fine-tuning in protein knowledge datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of ProLLM through rigorous validation against benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement over existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalizability. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs to transform the field of PPI, serving as a robust potential tool for various categories of biological and medical research.

        "title": "Ferret-v2: An Improved Baseline for Referring and Grounding with Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "While Ferret seamlessly integrates regional understanding into the Large Language Model (LLM) to facilitate its referring and grounding capability, it poses certain limitations: constrained by the pre-trained fixed visual encoder and failed to perform well on broader tasks. In this work, we unveil Ferret-v2, a significant upgrade to Ferret, with three key designs. (1) Any resolution grounding and referring: A flexible approach that effortlessly handles higher image resolution, improving the model's ability to process and understand images in greater detail. (2) Multi-granularity visual encoding: By integrating the additional DINOv2 encoder, the model learns better and diverse underlying contexts for global and fine-grained visual information. (3) A three-stage training paradigm: Besides image-caption alignment, an additional stage is proposed for high-resolution dense alignment before the final instruction tuning. Experiments show that Ferret-v2 provides substantial improvements over Ferret and other state-of-the-art methods, thanks to its high-resolution scaling and fine-grained visual processing."

        "title": "Reverse Training to Nurse the Reversal Curse",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have a surprising failure: when trained on A has a feature B, they do not generalize to B is a feature of A, which is termed the Reversal Curse. Even when training with trillions of tokens this issue still appears due to Zipf's law -- hence even if we train on the entire internet. This work proposes an alternative training scheme, called $reverse$ $training$, whereby all words are used twice, doubling the amount of available tokens. The LLM is trained in both forward and reverse directions by reversing training strings while preserving (i.e., not reversing) chosen substrings, such as entities. We show that data matched reverse-trained models provide superior performance to standard models on standard tasks, and compute matched reverse-trained models provide far superior performance on reversal tasks, helping resolve the reversal curse issue."

        "title": "IsoBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Foundation Models on Isomorphic Representations",
        "abstract": "Current foundation models exhibit impressive capabilities when prompted either with text only or with both image and text inputs. But do their capabilities change depending on the input modality? In this work, we propose IsoBench, a benchmark dataset containing problems from four major areas: math, science, algorithms, and games. Each example is presented with multiple isomorphic representations of inputs, such as visual, textual, and mathematical presentations. IsoBench provides fine-grained feedback to diagnose performance gaps caused by the form of the representation. Across various foundation models, we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations. Most prominently, when evaluated on all IsoBench problems, Claude-3 Opus performs 28.66 points worse when provided with images instead of text; similarly, GPT-4 Turbo is 18.71 points worse and Gemini Pro is 14.87 points worse. Finally, we present two prompting techniques, IsoCombination and IsoScratchPad, which improve model performance by considering combinations of, and translations between, different input representations."

        "title": "On Fairness of Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Models",
        "abstract": "Low-rank adaptation of large models, particularly LoRA, has gained traction due to its computational efficiency. This efficiency, contrasted with the prohibitive costs of full-model fine-tuning, means that practitioners often turn to LoRA without a complete understanding of its ramifications. In this study, we focus on fairness and ask whether LoRA has an unexamined impact on utility, calibration, and resistance to membership inference across different subgroups (e.g., genders, races, religions) compared to a full-model fine-tuning baseline. We present extensive experiments across vision and language domains and across classification and generation tasks using ViT-Base, Swin-v2-Large, Llama-2 7B, and Mistral 7B. Intriguingly, experiments suggest that while one can isolate cases where LoRA exacerbates model bias across subgroups, the pattern is inconsistent---in many cases, LoRA has equivalent or even improved fairness compared to the base model or its full fine-tuning baseline. We also examine the complications of evaluating fine-tuning fairness relating to task design and model token bias, calling for more careful fairness evaluations in future work."

        "title": "Will the Real Linda Please Stand up...to Large Language Models? Examining the Representativeness Heuristic in LLMs",
        "abstract": "Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in modeling text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so. Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic. This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example, versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence. This research investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning. We created ReHeAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics. Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to ReHeAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases. We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than on the problem's description. Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model to use its knowledge. This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases. It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while falling into a cognitive trap. This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it."

        "title": "Evaluating LLMs at Detecting Errors in LLM Responses",
        "abstract": "With Large Language Models (LLMs) being widely used across various tasks, detecting errors in their responses is increasingly crucial. However, little research has been conducted on error detection of LLM responses. Collecting error annotations on LLM responses is challenging due to the subjective nature of many NLP tasks, and thus previous research focuses on tasks of little practical value (e.g., word sorting) or limited error types (e.g., faithfulness in summarization). This work introduces ReaLMistake, the first error detection benchmark consisting of objective, realistic, and diverse errors made by LLMs. ReaLMistake contains three challenging and meaningful tasks that introduce objectively assessable errors in four categories (reasoning correctness, instruction-following, context-faithfulness, and parameterized knowledge), eliciting naturally observed and diverse errors in responses of GPT-4 and Llama 2 70B annotated by experts. We use ReaLMistake to evaluate error detectors based on 12 LLMs. Our findings show: 1) Top LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude 3 detect errors made by LLMs at very low recall, and all LLM-based error detectors perform much worse than humans. 2) Explanations by LLM-based error detectors lack reliability. 3) LLMs-based error detection is sensitive to small changes in prompts but remains challenging to improve. 4) Popular approaches to improving LLMs, including self-consistency and majority vote, do not improve the error detection performance. Our benchmark and code are provided at https://github.com/psunlpgroup/ReaLMistake."

        "title": "Massive Activations in Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "We observe an empirical phenomenon in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- very few activations exhibit significantly larger values than others (e.g., 100,000 times larger). We call them massive activations. First, we demonstrate the widespread existence of massive activations across various LLMs and characterize their locations. Second, we find their values largely stay constant regardless of the input, and they function as indispensable bias terms in LLMs. Third, these massive activations lead to the concentration of attention probabilities to their corresponding tokens, and further, implicit bias terms in the self-attention output. Last, we also study massive activations in Vision Transformers."
