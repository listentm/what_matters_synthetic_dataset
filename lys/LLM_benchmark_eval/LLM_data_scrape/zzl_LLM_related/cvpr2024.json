        "title": "Decomposing Disease Descriptions for Enhanced Pathology Detection: A Multi-Aspect Vision-Language Pre-training Framework",
        "abstract": "Medical vision language pre-training (VLP) has emerged as a frontier of research enabling zero-shot pathological recognition by comparing the query image with the textual descriptions for each disease. Due to the complex semantics of biomedical texts current methods struggle to align medical images with key pathological findings in unstructured reports. This leads to the misalignment with the target disease's textual representation. In this paper we introduce a novel VLP framework designed to dissect disease descriptions into their fundamental aspects leveraging prior knowledge about the visual manifestations of pathologies. This is achieved by consulting a large language model and medical experts. Integrating a Transformer module our approach aligns an input image with the diverse elements of a disease generating aspect-centric image representations. By consolidating the matches from each aspect we improve the compatibility between an image and its associated disease. Additionally capitalizing on the aspect-oriented representations we present a dual-head Transformer tailored to process known and unknown diseases optimizing the comprehensive detection efficacy. Conducting experiments on seven downstream datasets ours improves the accuracy of recent methods by up to 8.56% and 17.26% for seen and unseen categories respectively.

However existing video summarization datasets are notably limited in their size constraining the effectiveness of state-of-the-art methods for generalization. Our work aims to overcome this limitation by capitalizing on the abundance of long-form videos with dense speech-to-video alignment and the remarkable capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs) in summarizing long text. We introduce an automated and scalable pipeline for generating a large-scale video summarization dataset using LLMs as Oracle summarizers. By leveraging the generated dataset we analyze the limitations of existing approaches and propose a new video summarization model that effectively addresses them. To facilitate further research in the field our work also presents a new benchmark dataset that contains 1200 long videos each with high-quality summaries annotated by professionals. Extensive experiments clearly indicate that our proposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art in video summarization across several benchmarks."

        "abstract": "We present ChatScene a Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent that leverages the capabilities of LLMs to generate safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicles. Given unstructured language instructions the agent first generates textually described traffic scenarios using LLMs. These scenario descriptions are subsequently broken down into several sub-descriptions for specified details such as behaviors and locations of vehicles. The agent then distinctively transforms the textually described sub-scenarios into domain-specific languages which then generate actual code for prediction and control in simulators facilitating the creation of diverse and complex scenarios within the CARLA simulation environment. A key part of our agent is a comprehensive knowledge retrieval component which efficiently translates specific textual descriptions into corresponding domain-specific code snippets by training a knowledge database containing the scenario description and code pairs. Extensive experimental results underscore the efficacy of ChatScene in improving the safety of autonomous vehicles. For instance the scenarios generated by ChatScene show a 15% increase in collision rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines when tested against different reinforcement learning-based ego vehicles. Furthermore we show that by using our generated safety-critical scenarios to fine-tune different RL-based autonomous driving models they can achieve a 9% reduction in collision rates surpassing current SOTA methods. ChatScene effectively bridges the gap between textual descriptions of traffic scenarios and practical CARLA simulations providing a unified way to conveniently generate safety-critical scenarios for safety testing and improvement for AVs."

Despite achieving promising performance on certain metrics existing methods commonly suffer from drawbacks. Training-free methods often generate hallucinations whereas text-only-training methods may lack generalization capability. To address these challenges we propose a novel Memory-Augmented zero-shot image Captioning framework (MeaCap). This framework equipped with a textual memory incorporates a retrieve-then-filter module to extract key concepts highly relevant to the image. By leveraging our proposed memory-augmented visual-related fusion score within a keywords-to-sentence LM MeaCap generates concept-centered captions that exhibit high consistency with the image with reduced hallucinations and enriched world knowledge. MeaCap achieves state-of-the-art performance across various zero-shot IC settings. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/joeyz0z/MeaCap."

In this paper we propose the Decomposition-Integration Enhancing Multimodal Insight (DIEM) which initially decomposes the given question and image into multiple subquestions and several sub-images aiming to isolate specific elements for more focused analysis. We then integrate these sub-elements by matching each subquestion with its relevant sub-images while also retaining the original image to construct a comprehensive answer to the original question without losing sight of the overall context. This strategy mirrors the human cognitive process of simplifying complex problems into smaller components for individual analysis followed by an integration of these insights. We implement DIEM on the LLaVA-v1.5 model and evaluate its performance on ScienceQA and MM-Vet. Experimental results indicate that our method boosts accuracy in most question classes of the ScienceQA (+2.03% in average) especially in the image modality (+3.40%). On MM-Vet our method achieves an improvement in MM-Vet scores increasing from 31.1 to 32.4.

The VLMs provide stronger and more generalizable feature embeddings compared to those from ImageNet-pretrained models thanks to the training on the large-scale Internet image-text pairs. However despite the amazing achievement from the VLMs vanilla Vision Transformers (ViTs) remain the default choice for the image encoder. Although pure transformer proves its effectiveness in the text encoding area it remains questionable whether it is also the case for image encoding especially considering that various types of networks are proposed on the ImageNet benchmark which unfortunately are rarely studied in VLMs. Due to small data/model scale the original conclusions of model design on ImageNet can be limited and biased. In this paper we aim at building an evaluation protocol of vision models in the vision-language era under the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) framework. We provide a comprehensive way to benchmark different vision models covering their zero-shot performance and scalability in both model and training data sizes. To this end we introduce ViTamin a new vision models tailored for VLMs. ViTamin-L significantly outperforms ViT-L by 2.0% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy when using the same publicly available DataComp-1B dataset and the same OpenCLIP training scheme. ViTamin-L presents promising results on 60 diverse benchmarks including classification retrieval open-vocabulary detection and segmentation and large multi-modal models.

Specifically the LLaMA-Excitor does not directly change the intermediate hidden state during the self-attention calculation of the transformer structure. We designed the Excitor block as a bypass module for the similarity score computation in LLMs' self-attention to reconstruct keys and change the importance of values by learnable prompts.

Furthermore we unify the modeling of multi-modal tuning and language-only tuning extending LLaMA-Excitor to a powerful visual instruction follower without the need for complex multi-modal alignment. Our proposed approach is evaluated in language-only and multi-modal tuning experimental scenarios. Notably LLaMA-Excitor is the only method that maintains basic capabilities while achieving a significant improvement (+6%) on the MMLU benchmark.

In this regard studies on WSSGG have utilized image captions to obtain unlocalized triplets while primarily focusing on grounding the unlocalized triplets over image regions. However they have overlooked the two issues involved in the triplet formation process from the captions: 1) Semantic over-simplification issue arises when extracting triplets from captions where fine-grained predicates in captions are undesirably converted into coarse-grained predicates resulting in a long-tailed predicate distribution and 2) Low-density scene graph issue arises when aligning the triplets in the caption with entity/predicate classes of interest where many triplets are discarded and not used in training leading to insufficient supervision. To tackle the two issues we propose a new approach i.e. Large Language Model for weakly-supervised SGG (LLM4SGG) where we mitigate the two issues by leveraging the LLM's in-depth understanding of language and reasoning ability during the extraction of triplets from captions and alignment of entity/predicate classes with target data. To further engage the LLM in these processes we adopt the idea of Chain-of-Thought and the in-context few-shot learning strategy. To validate the effectiveness of LLM4SGG we conduct extensive experiments on Visual Genome and GQA datasets showing significant improvements in both Recall@K and mean Recall@K compared to the state-of-the-art WSSGG methods. A further appeal is that LLM4SGG is data-efficient enabling effective model training with a small amount of training images."

We study the possibility of selective prediction for vision-language models in a realistic black-box setting. We propose using the principle of neighborhood consistency to identify unreliable responses from a black-box vision-language model in question answering tasks. We hypothesize that given only a visual question and model response the consistency of the model's responses over the neighborhood of a visual question will indicate reliability. It is impossible to directly sample neighbors in feature space in a black-box setting. Instead we show that it is possible to use a smaller proxy model to approximately sample from the neighborhood. We find that neighborhood consistency can be used to identify model responses to visual questions that are likely unreliable even in adversarial settings or settings that are out-of-distribution to the proxy model."

Among them some works use large model architectures as backbones of their recognizers to boost the skeleton data representation capability while some other works pre-train their recognizers on external data to enrich the knowledge. In this work we observe that large language models which have been extensively used in various natural language processing tasks generally hold both large model architectures and rich implicit knowledge. Motivated by this we propose a novel LLM-AR framework in which we investigate treating the Large Language Model as an Action Recognizer. In our framework we propose a linguistic projection process to project each input action signal (i.e. each skeleton sequence) into its \"sentence format\" (i.e. an \"action sentence\"). Moreover we also incorporate our framework with several designs to further facilitate this linguistic projection process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework."

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are fine-tuned using human comparison data with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methods to make them better aligned with users' preferences. In contrast to LLMs human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective. Using the Pick-a-pic dataset of 851K crowdsourced pairwise preferences we fine-tune the base model of the state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)-1.0 model with Diffusion-DPO. Our fine-tuned base model significantly outperforms both base SDXL-1.0 and the larger SDXL-1.0 model consisting of an additional refinement model in human evaluation improving visual appeal and prompt alignment. We also develop a variant that uses AI feedback and has comparable performance to training on human preferences opening the door for scaling of diffusion model alignment methods."

In contrast contemporary machine learning paradigms exhibit limitations in emulating the facets of continual learning (CL). Nonetheless the emergence of large language models (LLMs) presents promising avenues for realizing CL via interactions with these models. Drawing on Complementary Learning System theory this paper presents a novel Interactive Continual Learning (ICL) framework enabled by collaborative interactions among models of various sizes. Specifically we assign the ViT model as System1 and multimodal LLM as System2. To enable the memory module to deduce tasks from class information and enhance Set2Set retrieval we propose the Class-Knowledge-Task Multi-Head Attention (CKT-MHA). Additionally to improve memory retrieval in System1 through enhanced geometric representation we introduce the CL-vMF mechanism based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Meanwhile we introduce the von Mises-Fisher Outlier Detection and Interaction (vMF-ODI) strategy to identify hard examples thus enhancing collaboration between System1 and System2 for complex reasoning realization. Comprehensive evaluation of our proposed ICL demonstrates significant resistance to forgetting and superior performance relative to existing methods. Code is available at github.com/ICL."

Recently pre-trained vision transformers combined with prompt tuning have shown promise for overcoming catastrophic forgetting in CL. These approaches rely on a pool of learnable prompts which can be inefficient in sharing knowledge across tasks leading to inferior performance. In addition the lack of fine-grained layer specific prompts does not allow these to fully express the strength of the prompts for CL. We address these limitations by proposing ConvPrompt a novel convolutional prompt creation mechanism that maintains layer-wise shared embeddings enabling both layer-specific learning and better concept transfer across tasks. The intelligent use of convolution enables us to maintain a low parameter overhead without compromising performance. We further leverage Large Language Models to generate fine-grained text descriptions of each category which are used to get task similarity and dynamically decide the number of prompts to be learned. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ConvPrompt and improves SOTA by 3% with significantly less parameter overhead. We also perform strong ablation over various modules to disentangle the importance of different components."

Traditionally developing classifiers for such concepts requires substantial manual effort measured in hours days or even months to identify and annotate data needed for training. Even with recently proposed Agile Modeling techniques which enable rapid bootstrapping of image classifiers users are still required to spend 30 minutes or more of monotonous repetitive data labeling just to train a single classifier. Drawing on Fiske's Cognitive Miser theory we propose a new framework that alleviates manual effort by replacing human labeling with natural language interactions reducing the total effort required to define a concept by an order of magnitude: from labeling 2000 images to only 100 plus some natural language interactions. Our framework leverages recent advances in foundation models both large language models and vision-language models to carve out the concept space through conversation and by automatically labeling training data points. Most importantly our framework eliminates the need for crowd-sourced annotations. Moreover our framework ultimately produces lightweight classification models that are deployable in cost-sensitive scenarios. Across 15 subjective concepts and across 2 public image classification datasets our trained models outperform traditional Agile Modeling as well as state-of-the-art zero-shot classification models like ALIGN CLIP CuPL and large visual question answering models like PaLI-X."

Moreover prior work suggests that compositionality doesn't arise with scale: larger model sizes or training data don't help. This paper develops a new iterated training algorithm that incentivizes compositionality. We draw on decades of cognitive science research that identifies cultural transmission--the need to teach a new generation--as a necessary inductive prior that incentivizes humans to develop compositional languages.

GROUNDHOG incorporates a masked feature extractor and converts extracted features into visual entity tokens for the MLLM backbone which then connects groundable phrases to unified grounding masks by retrieving and merging the entity masks. To train GROUNDHOG we carefully curated M3G2 a grounded visual instruction tuning dataset with Multi-Modal Multi-Grained Grounding by harvesting a collection of segmentation-grounded datasets with rich annotations. Our experimental results show that GROUNDHOG achieves superior performance on various language grounding tasks without task-specific fine-tuning and significantly reduces object hallucination. GROUNDHOG also demonstrates better grounding towards complex forms of visual input and provides easy-to-understand diagnosis in failure cases."

However the methods used by existing frameworks to curate such multimodal data in particular language descriptions for 3D shapes are not scalable and the collected language descriptions are not diverse. To address this we introduce ULIP-2 a simple yet effective tri-modal pretraining framework that leverages large multimodal models to automatically generate holistic language descriptions for 3D shapes. It only needs 3D data as input eliminating the need for any manual 3D annotations and is therefore scalable to large datasets. ULIP-2 is also equipped with scaled-up backbones for better multi-modal representation learning. We conduct experiments on two large-scale 3D datasets Objaverse and ShapeNet and augment them with tri-modal datasets of 3D point clouds images and language for training ULIP-2. Experiments show that ULIP-2 demonstrates substantial benefits in three downstream tasks: zero-shot 3D classification standard 3D classification with fine-tuning and 3D captioning (3D-to-language generation). It achieves a new SOTA of 50.6% (top- 1) on Objaverse-LVIS and 84.7% (top-1) on ModelNet40 in zero-shot classification. In the ScanObjectNN benchmark for standard fine-tuning ULIP-2 reaches an overall accuracy of 91.5% with a compact model of only 1.4 million parameters.

Equipped with individual adapter for each patch Monkey can handle higher resolutions up to 1344x896 pixels enabling the detailed capture of complex visual information.

We first learn a vocabulary of latent quantized embeddings using graph convolutions which inform these embeddings of the local mesh geometry and topology.

While effective for logical tasks CoT is not conducive to creative problem-solving which often requires out-of-box thoughts and is crucial for innovation advancements. In this paper we explore the Leap-of-Thought (LoT) abilities within LLMs -- a non-sequential creative paradigm involving strong associations and knowledge leaps. To this end we study LLMs on the popular Oogiri game which needs participants to have good creativity and strong associative thinking for responding unexpectedly and humorously to the given image text or both and thus is suitable for LoT study. Then to investigate LLMs' LoT ability in the Oogiri game we first build a multimodal and multilingual Oogiri-GO dataset which contains over 130000 samples from the Oogiri game and observe the insufficient LoT ability or failures of most existing LLMs on the Oogiri game. Accordingly we introduce a creative Leap-of-Thought (CLoT) paradigm to improve LLM's LoT ability. CLoT first formulates the Oogiri-GO dataset into LoT-oriented instruction tuning data to train pretrained LLM for achieving certain LoT humor generation and discrimination abilities. Then CLoT designs an explorative self-refinement that encourages the LLM to generate more creative LoT data via exploring parallels between seemingly unrelated concepts and selects high-quality data to train itself for self-refinement. CLoT not only excels in humor generation in the Oogiri game as shown in Fig. 1 but also boosts creative abilities in various tasks like \"cloud guessing game\" and \"divergent association task\".

Recently Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in WSI classification. However existing methods leverage coarse-grained pathogenetic descriptions for visual representation supervision which are insufficient to capture the complex visual appearance of pathogenetic images hindering the generalizability of models on diverse downstream tasks. Additionally processing high-resolution WSIs can be computationally expensive. In this paper we propose a novel \"Fine-grained Visual-Semantic Interaction\" (FiVE) framework for WSI classification. It is designed to enhance the model's generalizability by leveraging the interaction between localized visual patterns and fine-grained pathological semantics. Specifically with meticulously designed queries we start by utilizing a large language model to extract fine-grained pathological descriptions from various non-standardized raw reports. The output descriptions are then reconstructed into fine-grained labels used for training. By introducing a Task-specific Fine-grained Semantics (TFS) module we enable prompts to capture crucial visual information in WSIs which enhances representation learning and augments generalization capabilities significantly. Furthermore given that pathological visual patterns are redundantly distributed across tissue slices we sample a subset of visual instances during training.

        "abstract": "Mitigating hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) remains an open problem. Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses which we term \"Type I hallucinations\". Instead they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats---typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute---which we term \"Type II hallucinations\". Additionally such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of hallucinations are often anti-correlated. To address this we propose THRONE a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline."

These architectures typically comprise a vision encoder a Large Language Model (LLM) and a projection module that aligns visual features with the LLM's representation space. Despite their success a critical limitation persists: the vision encoding process remains decoupled from user queries often in the form of image-related questions. Consequently the resulting visual features may not be optimally attuned to the query-specific elements of the image. To address this we introduce QA-ViT a Question Aware Vision Transformer approach for multimodal reasoning which embeds question awareness directly within the vision encoder. This integration results in dynamic visual features focusing on relevant image aspects to the posed question. QA-ViT is model-agnostic and can be incorporated efficiently into any VL architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of applying our method to various multimodal architectures leading to consistent improvement across diverse tasks and showcasing its potential for enhancing visual and scene-text understanding."

In this work we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover to assign the best descriptors with different video instances we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot few-shot and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach.

        "title": "PromptCoT: Align Prompt Distribution via Adapted Chain-of-Thought",
        "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative models have exhibited remarkable capability in the production of high-fidelity visual content such as images and videos. However their performance is significantly contingent upon the quality of textual inputs commonly referred to as \"prompts\". The process of traditional prompt engineering while effective necessitates empirical expertise and poses challenges for inexperienced users. In this paper we introduce PromptCoT an innovative enhancer that autonomously refines prompts for users. PromptCoT is designed based on the observation that prompts which resemble the textual information of high-quality images in the training set often lead to superior generation performance. Therefore we fine-tune the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLM) using a curated text dataset that solely comprises descriptions of high-quality visual content. By doing so the LLM can capture the distribution of high-quality training texts enabling it to generate aligned continuations and revisions to boost the original texts. Nonetheless one drawback of pre-trained LLMs is their tendency to generate extraneous or irrelevant information. We employ the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism to improve the alignment between the original text prompts and their refined versions. CoT can extract and amalgamate crucial information from the aligned continuation and revision enabling reasonable inferences based on the contextual cues to produce a more comprehensive and nuanced final output. Considering computational efficiency instead of allocating a dedicated LLM for prompt enhancement to each individual model or dataset we integrate adapters that facilitate dataset-specific adaptation leveraging a shared pre-trained LLM as the foundation for this process. With independent fine-tuning of these adapters we can adapt PromptCoT to new datasets while minimally increasing training costs and memory usage. We evaluate the effectiveness of PromptCoT by assessing its performance on widely-used latent diffusion models for image and video generation. The results demonstrate significant improvements in key performance metrics."

        "abstract": "Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have been shown to efficiently integrate natural language with visual information to handle multi-modal tasks. However MLLMs still face a fundamental limitation of hallucinations where they tend to generate erroneous or fabricated information. In this paper we address hallucinations in MLLMs from a novel perspective of representation learning. We first analyzed the representation distribution of textual and visual tokens in MLLM revealing two important findings: 1) there is a significant gap between textual and visual representations indicating unsatisfactory cross-modal representation alignment; 2) representations of texts that contain and do not contain hallucinations are entangled making it challenging to distinguish them. These two observations inspire us with a simple yet effective method to mitigate hallucinations. Specifically we introduce contrastive learning into MLLMs and use text with hallucination as hard negative examples naturally bringing representations of non-hallucinative text and visual samples closer while pushing way representations of non-hallucinating and hallucinative text. We evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively showing its effectiveness in reducing hallucination occurrences and improving performance across multiple benchmarks. On the MMhal-Bench benchmark our method obtains a 34.66% /29.5% improvement over the baseline MiniGPT-4/LLaVA. Our code is available on https://github.com/X-PLUG/mPLUG-HalOwl/tree/main/hacl."

However the capability of VLMs to \"think\" from a first-person perspective a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap we introduce EgoThink a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from egocentric videos with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs we evaluate twenty-one popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover given the open-ended format of the answers we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics."

Multi-modal LLMs empower multi-modality understanding with the capability of semantic generation yet bring less explainability and heavier reliance on prompt contents due to their autoregressive generative nature. While manipulating prompt formats could improve outputs designing specific and precise prompts per task can be challenging and ineffective. To tackle this issue we introduce a novel inference method Prompt Highlighter which enables users to highlight specific prompt spans to interactively control the focus during generation. Motivated by the classifier-free diffusion guidance we form regular and unconditional context pairs based on highlighted tokens demonstrating that the autoregressive generation in models can be guided in a classifier-free way. Notably we find that during inference guiding the models with highlighted tokens through the attention weights leads to more desired outputs. Our approach is compatible with current LLMs and VLMs achieving impressive customized generation results without training. Experiments confirm its effectiveness in focusing on input contexts and generating reliable content. Without tuning on LLaVA-v1.5 our method secured 70.7 in the MMBench test and 1552.5 in MME-perception."

A few recent studies attempt to tackle a more realistic setting open-set VAD which aims to detect unseen anomalies given seen anomalies and normal videos. However such a setting focuses on predicting frame anomaly scores having no ability to recognize the specific categories of anomalies despite the fact that this ability is essential for building more informed video surveillance systems. This paper takes a step further and explores open-vocabulary video anomaly detection (OVVAD) in which we aim to leverage pre-trained large models to detect and categorize seen and unseen anomalies. To this end we propose a model that decouples OVVAD into two mutually complementary tasks - class-agnostic detection and class-specific classification - and jointly optimizes both tasks. Particularly we devise a semantic knowledge injection module to introduce semantic knowledge from large language models for the detection task and design a novel anomaly synthesis module to generate pseudo unseen anomaly videos with the help of large vision generation models for the classification task. These semantic knowledge and synthesis anomalies substantially extend our model's capability in detecting and categorizing a variety of seen and unseen anomalies. Extensive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on OVVAD task."

Reward-gradient guided denoising has been recently proposed to generate trajectories that maximize both a differentiable reward function and the likelihood under the data distribution captured by a diffusion model. Reward-gradient guided denoising requires a differentiable reward function fitted to both clean and noised samples limiting its applicability as a general trajectory optimizer. In this paper we propose DiffusionES a method that combines gradient-free optimization with trajectory denoising to optimize black-box non-differentiable objectives while staying in the data manifold. Diffusion-ES samples trajectories during evolutionary search from a diffusion model and scores them using a black-box reward function. It mutates high-scoring trajectories using a truncated diffusion process that applies a small number of noising and denoising steps allowing for much more efficient exploration of the solution space. We show that DiffusionES achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuPlan an established closed-loop planning benchmark for autonomous driving. Diffusion-ES outperforms existing sampling-based planners reactive deterministic or diffusion-based policies and reward-gradient guidance. Additionally we show that unlike prior guidance methods our method can optimize non-differentiable language-shaped reward functions generated by few-shot LLM prompting. When guided by a human teacher that issues instructions to follow our method can generate novel highly complex behaviors such as aggressive lane weaving which are not present in the training data. This allows us to solve the hardest nuPlan scenarios which are beyond the capabilities of existing trajectory optimization methods and driving policies."

To this end we first collect Multisensory Universe a large-scale multisensory interaction dataset comprising 500k data by deploying an LLM-powered embodied agent to engage with the 3D environment. To perform instruction tuning with pre-trained LLM on such generated data we first encode the 3D scene as abstracted object-centric representations and then introduce action tokens denoting that the embodied agent takes certain actions within the environment as well as state tokens that represent the multisensory state observations of the agent at each time step. In the inference time MultiPLY could generate action tokens instructing the agent to take the action in the environment and obtain the next multisensory state observation. The observation is then appended back to the LLM via state tokens to generate subsequent text or action tokens.

The core of LayoutLLM is a layout instruction tuning strategy which is specially designed to enhance the comprehension and utilization of document layouts. The proposed layout instruction tuning strategy consists of two components: Layout-aware Pre-training and Layout-aware Supervised Fine-tuning.

To address the scarcity problem of regional caption data we propose to first pre-train our model on objection detection and segmentation tasks.

The weak supervision pretraining allows us to leverage many publicly available object detection and segmentation datasets. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our method and validate each design choice.

However training SparseFormers from scratch is still expensive and scaling up the number of parameters can be challenging. In this paper we propose to bootstrap SparseFormers from ViT-based vision foundation models in a simple and efficient way. Since the majority of SparseFormer blocks are the standard transformer ones we can inherit weights from large-scale pre-trained vision transformers and freeze them as much as possible. Therefore we only need to train the SparseFormer-specific lightweight focusing transformer to adjust token RoIs and fine-tune a few early pre-trained blocks to align the final token representation. In such a way we can bootstrap SparseFormer architectures from various large-scale pre-trained models (e.g. IN-21K pre-trained AugRegs or CLIPs) using a rather smaller amount of training samples (e.g. IN-1K) and without labels or captions within just a few hours. As a result the bootstrapped unimodal SparseFormer (from AugReg-ViT-L/16-384) can reach 84.9% accuracy on IN-1K with only 49 tokens and the multimodal SparseFormer from CLIPs also demonstrates notable zero-shot performance with highly reduced computational cost without seeing any caption during the bootstrapping procedure. In addition CLIP-bootstrapped SparseFormers which align the output space with language without seeing a word can serve as efficient vision encoders in multimodal large language models.

Common solution relies on a laborious curation process to collect visual guide for each oracle (Fig.1) which hinges on the case-by-case effort and taste of curators. This paper delves into one natural follow-up question: can AI take over?Begin with a comprehensive human study we show participants could indeed make better sense of an oracle glyph subjected to a proper visual guide and its efficacy can be approximated via a novel metric termed TransOV (Transferable Oracle Visuals).

At its heart is to leverage foundation model like GPT-4V to reason about the visual cues hidden inside an oracle and take advantage of an existing text-to-image model for final visual guide generation. Extensive empirical evidence shows our AI-enabled visual guides achieve significantly comparable TransOV performance compared with those collected under manual efforts.

Inspired by how humans reason about physics through vision we leverage large language models to propose candidate materials for each object. We then construct a language-embedded point cloud and estimate the physical properties of each 3D point using a zero-shot kernel regression approach. Our method is accurate annotation-free and applicable to any object in the open world. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various physical property reasoning tasks such as estimating the mass of common objects as well as other properties like friction and hardness."

Furthermore the interaction between users and models are still limited to directive and descriptive prompts such as instructions and captions. In this work we build a customization assistant based on pre-trained large language model and diffusion model which can not only perform customized generation in a tuning-free manner but also enable more user-friendly interactions: users can chat with the assistant and input either ambiguous text or clear instruction. Specifically we propose a new framework consists of a new model design and a novel training strategy. The resulting assistant can perform customized generation in 2-5 seconds without any test time fine-tuning. Extensive experiments are conducted competitive results have been obtained across different domains illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed method."

The gigapixel scale of WSIs poses a challenge for histopathology multi-modal models. Training multi-model models for histopathology requires instruction tuning datasets which currently contain information for individual image patches without a spatial grounding of the concepts within each patch and without a wider view of the WSI. To bridge this gap we introduce QUILT-INSTRUCT a large-scale dataset of 107131 histopathology-specific instruction question/answer pairs grounded within diagnostically relevant image patches that make up the WSI. Our dataset is collected by leveraging educational histopathology videos from YouTube which provides spatial localization of narrations by automatically extracting the narrators' cursor positions. QUILT-INSTRUCT supports contextual reasoning by extracting diagnosis and supporting facts from the entire WSI. Using QUILT-INSTRUCT we train QUILT-LLAVA which can reason beyond the given single image patch enabling diagnostic reasoning across patches. To evaluate QUILT-LLAVA we propose a comprehensive evaluation dataset created from 985 images and 1283 human-generated question-answers. We also thoroughly evaluate QUILT-LLAVA using public histopathology datasets where QUILT-LLAVA significantly outperforms SOTA by over 10% on relative GPT-4 score and 4% and 9% on open and closed set VQA."

To address this we collect the first dataset consisting of human natural language feedback on low-level vision. Each feedback offers a comprehensive description of an image's low-level visual attributes culminating in an overall quality assessment. The constructed Q-Pathway dataset includes 58K detailed human feedbacks on 18973 multi-sourced images with diverse low-level appearance.

First they do not capture both short-range and long-range temporal dependencies and typically employ complex hierarchical deep network architectures that are hard to integrate with existing pretrained image-text foundation models. To effectively address this limitation we instead keep the network architecture simple and use a set of data tokens that operate at different temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner accounting for the temporally hierarchical nature of videos. By employing a simple two-tower architecture we are able to initialize our video-language model with pretrained image-text foundation models thereby boosting the final performance. Second existing video-language alignment works struggle due to the lack of semantically aligned large-scale training data. To overcome it we leverage recent LLMs to curate the largest video-language dataset to date with better visual grounding. Furthermore unlike existing video-text datasets which only contain short clips our dataset is enriched with video clips of varying durations to aid our temporally hierarchical data tokens in extracting better representations at varying temporal scales. Overall empirical results show that our proposed approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on multiple retrieval benchmarks especially on longer videos and performs competitively on classification benchmarks."

Data augmentation provides a practical solution to overcome the issue of data scarcity however most augmentation methods exhibit a limited focus prioritising either image or text augmentation exclusively. Acknowledging this limitation our objective is to devise a framework capable of concurrently augmenting medical image and text data. We design a Pairwise Augmentation (PairAug) approach that contains an Inter-patient Augmentation (InterAug) branch and an Intra-patient Augmentation (IntraAug) branch. Specifically the InterAug branch of our approach generates radiology images using synthesised yet plausible reports derived from a Large Language Model (LLM). The generated pairs can be considered a collection of new patient cases since they are artificially created and may not exist in the original dataset. In contrast the IntraAug branch uses newly generated reports to manipulate images. This process allows us to create new paired data for each individual with diverse medical conditions. Our extensive experiments on various downstream tasks covering medical image classification zero-shot and fine-tuning analysis demonstrate that our PairAug concurrently expanding both image and text data substantially outperforms image-/text-only expansion baselines and advanced medical VLP baselines.

To mitigate these limitations numerous studies have endeavored to fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion models i.e.. UNet utilizing various technologies. Yet amidst these efforts a pivotal question of text-to-image diffusion model training has remained largely unexplored: Is it possible and feasible to fine-tune the text encoder to improve the performance of text-to-image diffusion models? Our findings reveal that instead of replacing the CLIP text encoder used in Stable Diffusion with other large language models we can enhance it through our proposed fine-tuning approach TextCraftor leading to substantial improvements in quantitative benchmarks and human assessments.

However many VLMs rely on proprietary data and are not open-source which restricts the use of white-box approaches for fine-tuning. As such we aim to develop a black-box approach to optimize VLMs through  natural language prompts  thereby avoiding the need to access model parameters feature embeddings or even output logits. We propose employing chat-based LLMs to search for the best text prompt for VLMs. Specifically we adopt an automatic \"hill-climbing\" procedure that converges to an effective prompt by evaluating the performance of current prompts and asking LLMs to refine them based on textual feedback all within a conversational process without human-in-the-loop. In a challenging 1-shot image classification setup our simple approach surpasses the white-box continuous prompting method (CoOp) by an average of 1.5% across 11 datasets including ImageNet. Our approach also outperforms both human-engineered and LLM-generated prompts. We highlight the advantage of conversational feedback that incorporates both positive and negative prompts suggesting that LLMs can utilize the implicit \"gradient\" direction in textual feedback for a more efficient search. In addition we find that the text prompts generated through our strategy are not only more interpretable but also transfer well across different VLM architectures in a black-box manner. Lastly we demonstrate our framework on a state-of-the-art black-box VLM (DALL-E 3) for text-to-image optimization."

To mitigate this issue we introduce Visual Contrastive Decoding (VCD) a simple and training-free method that contrasts output distributions derived from original and distorted visual inputs. The proposed VCD effectively reduces the over-reliance on statistical bias and unimodal priors two essential causes of object hallucinations. This adjustment ensures the generated content is closely grounded to visual inputs resulting in contextually accurate outputs.

To address the challenge we present RLHF-V which enhances MLLM trustworthiness via behavior alignment from fine-grained correctional human feedback. Specifically RLHF-V collects human preference in the form of segment-level corrections on hallucinations and performs dense direct preference optimization over the human feedback. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks in both automatic and human evaluation show that RLHF-V can enable substantially more trustworthy MLLM behaviors with promising data and computation efficiency. Remarkably using 1.4k annotated data samples RLHF-V significantly reduces the hallucination rate of the base MLLM by 34.8% outperforming the concurrent LLaVA-RLHF trained on 10k annotated data. The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance in trustworthiness among open-source MLLMs and shows better robustness than GPT-4V in preventing hallucinations aroused from over-generalization.

Without incorporating extra feedback they are still prone to generate unhelpful hallucinated or harmful responses. Second while the visual instruction tuning data is generally structured in a multi-turn dialogue format the connections and dependencies among consecutive conversational turns are weak. This reduces the capacity for effective multi-turn interactions. To tackle these we propose a novel categorization of the NLF into two key types: critique and refinement. The critique NLF identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the responses and is used to align the LVLMs with human preferences. The refinement NLF offers concrete suggestions for improvement and is adopted to improve the interaction ability of the LVLMs-- which focuses on LVLMs' ability to refine responses by incorporating feedback in multi-turn interactions. To address the non-differentiable nature of NLF we generalize conditional reinforcement learning for training. Our experimental results demonstrate that DRESS can generate more helpful (9.76%) honest (11.52%) and harmless (21.03%) responses and more effectively learn from feedback during multi-turn interactions compared to SOTA LVLMs."

In this paper we present OPERA a novel MLLM decoding method grounded in an Over-trust Penalty and a Retrospection-Allocation strategy serving as a nearly free lunch to alleviate the hallucination issue without additional data knowledge or training. Our approach begins with an interesting observation that most hallucinations are closely tied to the knowledge aggregation patterns manifested in the self-attention matrix i.e. MLLMs tend to generate new tokens by focusing on a few summary tokens but not all the previous tokens. Such partial over-trust inclination results in the neglecting of image tokens and describes the image content with hallucination. Based on the observation OPERA introduces a penalty term on the model logits during the beam-search decoding to mitigate the over-trust issue along with a rollback strategy that retrospects the presence of summary tokens in the previously generated tokens and re-allocate the token selection if necessary. With extensive experiments OPERA shows significant hallucination-mitigating performance on different MLLMs and metrics proving its effectiveness and generality.

In-Context Learning (ICL) explores training-free few-shot learning where models are encouraged to \"learn to learn\" from limited tasks and generalize to unseen tasks.

By providing demonstrations with causal links LCL guides the model to discern not only the analogy but also the underlying causal associations between data points which empowers MLLMs to recognize unseen images and understand novel concepts more effectively.

Testing 25 CLIP variants in a zero-shot classification task we find that their accuracy is 15 percentage points lower on average for images captured by BLV users than web-crawled images. This disparity stems from CLIP's sensitivities to 1) image content (e.g. not recognizing disability objects as well as other objects); 2) image quality (e.g. not being robust to lighting variation); and 3) text content (e.g. not recognizing objects described by tactile adjectives as well as visual ones). We delve deeper with a textual analysis of three common pre-training datasets: LAION-400M LAION-2B and DataComp-1B showing that disability content is rarely mentioned. We then provide three examples that illustrate how the performance disparities extend to three downstream models underpinned by CLIP: OWL-ViT CLIPSeg and DALL-E2. We find that few-shot learning with as few as 5 images can mitigate CLIP's quality-of-service disparities for BLV users in some scenarios which we discuss alongside a set of other possible mitigations."

        "abstract": "We introduce PlausiVL a large video-language model for anticipating action sequences that are plausible in the real-world. While significant efforts have been made towards anticipating future actions prior approaches do not take into account the aspect of plausibility in an action sequence. To address this limitation we explore the generative capability of a large video-language model in our work and further develop the understanding of plausibility in an action sequence by introducing two objective functions a counterfactual-based plausible action sequence learning loss and a long-horizon action repetition loss. We utilize temporal logical constraints as well as verb-noun action pair logical constraints to create implausible/counterfactual action sequences and use them to train the model with plausible action sequence learning loss. This loss helps the model to differentiate between plausible and not plausible action sequences and also helps the model to learn implicit temporal cues crucial for the task of action anticipation. The long-horizon action repetition loss puts a higher penalty on the actions that are more prone to repetition over a longer temporal window. With this penalization the model is able to generate diverse plausible action sequences. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale datasets Ego4D and EPIC-Kitchens-100 and show improvements on the task of action anticipation."

        "abstract": "Generating human motions from textual descriptions has gained growing research interest due to its wide range of applications. However only a few works consider human-scene interactions together with text conditions which is crucial for visual and physical realism. This paper focuses on the task of generating human motions in 3D indoor scenes given text descriptions of the human-scene interactions. This task presents challenges due to the multimodality nature of text scene and motion as well as the need for spatial reasoning. To address these challenges we propose a new approach that decomposes the complex problem into two more manageable sub-problems: (1) language grounding of the target object and (2) object-centric motion generation. For language grounding of the target object we leverage the power of large language models. For motion generation we design an object-centric scene representation for the generative model to focus on the target object thereby reducing the scene complexity and facilitating the modeling of the relationship between human motions and the object. Experiments demonstrate the better motion quality of our approach compared to baselines and validate our design choices. Code will be available at https://zju3dv.github.io/text_scene_motion."

Recent work shows promise by decomposing such tasks using a large language model (LLM) into an executable program that invokes specialized vision models. However generated programs are error-prone: they omit necessary steps include spurious ones and are unable to recover when the specialized models give incorrect outputs. Moreover they require loading multiple models incurring high latency and computation costs. We propose Visual Program Distillation (VPD) an instruction-tuning framework that produces a vision-language model (VLM) capable of solving complex visual tasks with a single forward pass. VPD distills the reasoning ability of LLMs by using them to sample multiple candidate programs which are then executed and verified to identify the correct one. It translates each correct program into a language description of the reasoning steps which are then distilled into a VLM. Extensive experiments show that VPD improves the VLM's ability to count understand spatial relations and reason compositionally. Our VPD-trained PaLI-X outperforms all prior VLMs achieving state-of-the-art performance across complex vision tasks including MMBench OK-VQA A-OKVQA TallyQA POPE and Hateful Memes. An evaluation with human annotators also confirms that VPD improves model response factuality and consistency.

Conducting user preference studies is an alternative that offers both adaptability and human-aligned results. User studies however can be very expensive to scale. This paper presents an automatic versatile and human-aligned evaluation metric for text-to-3D generative models. To this end we first develop a prompt generator using GPT-4V to generate evaluating prompts which serve as input to compare text-to-3D models.

We propose LAAT a Language-driven Anchor-based Adversarial Training strategy. LAAT utilizes the features of a text encoder for each category as fixed anchors (normalized feature embeddings) for each category which are then employed for adversarial training. By leveraging the semantic consistency of the text encoders LAAT aims to enhance the adversarial robustness of the image model on novel categories. However naively using text encoders leads to poor results. Through analysis we identified the issue to be the high cosine similarity between text encoders. We then design an expansion algorithm and an alignment cross-entropy loss to alleviate the problem.

Recently vision language model (VLM)-based methods introduced the language prior by pre-training on large-scale pathological image-text pairs. However the previous text prompt lacks the consideration of pathological prior knowledge therefore does not substantially boost the model's performance.

Extensive experiments show that CapsFusion captions exhibit remarkable all-round superiority over existing captions in terms of model performance (e.g. 18.8 and 18.3 improvements in CIDEr score on COCO and NoCaps) sample efficiency (requiring 11-16 times less computation than baselines) world knowledge depth and scalability. These effectiveness efficiency and scalability advantages position CapsFusion as a promising candidate for future scaling of LMM training."

        "abstract": "Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks. Out-Of-Context (OOC) misinformation where authentic images are repurposed with false text is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments which are essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle cross-modal differences. In this paper we introduce Sniffer a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. Sniffer employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages OOC-specific instruction data generated by language-only GPT-4 to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval Sniffer not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that Sniffer surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. Sniffer also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations."

Recently considering diverse deployment scenarios with various resource budgets SN-Net is introduced to quickly obtain numerous new networks (stitches) from the pre-trained models (anchors) in a model family via model stitching. Although promising SN-Net confronts new challenges when adapting it to new target domains including huge memory and storage requirements and a long and sub-optimal multistage adaptation process. In this work we present a novel framework Efficient Stitchable Task Adaptation (ESTA) to efficiently produce a palette of fine-tuned models that adhere to diverse resource constraints. Specifically we first tailor parameter-efficient fine-tuning to share low-rank updates among the stitches while maintaining independent bias terms. In this way we largely reduce fine-tuning memory burdens and mitigate the interference among stitches that arises in task adaptation. Furthermore we streamline a simple yet effective one-stage deployment pipeline which estimates the important stitches to deploy with training-time gradient statistics. By assigning higher sampling probabilities to important stitches we also get a boosted Pareto frontier. Extensive experiments on 25 downstream visual recognition tasks demonstrate that our ESTA is capable of generating stitches with smooth accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and surpasses the direct SN-Net adaptation by remarkable margins with significantly lower training time and fewer trainable parameters. Furthermore we demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our ESTA framework by stitching LLMs from LLaMA family obtaining chatbot stitches of assorted sizes."

Current approaches straightforwardly convert video into language tokens and employ large language models for multi-modal tasks. However this method often leads to the generation of irrelevant content commonly known as \"hallucination\" as the length of the text increases and the impact of the video diminishes. To address this problem we propose Vista-LLaMA a novel framework that maintains the consistent distance between all visual tokens and any language tokens irrespective of the generated text length. Vista-LLaMA omits relative position encoding when determining attention weights between visual and text tokens retaining the position encoding for text and text tokens. This amplifies the effect of visual tokens on text generation especially when the relative distance is longer between visual and text tokens. The proposed attention mechanism significantly reduces the chance of producing irrelevant text related to the video content. Furthermore we present a sequential visual projector that projects the current video frame into tokens of language space with the assistance of the previous frame. This approach not only captures the temporal relationship within the video but also allows less visual tokens to encompass the entire video. Our approach significantly outperforms various previous methods (e.g. Video-ChatGPT MovieChat) on four challenging open-ended video question answering benchmarks. We reach an accuracy of 60.7 on the zero-shot NExT-QA and 60.5 on the zero-shot MSRVTT-QA setting a new state-of-the-art performance."

However in several cases their expensive training and data collection/curation costs do not justify the end application. This motivates a vendor-client paradigm where a vendor trains a large-scale VLM and grants only input-output access to clients on a pay-per-query basis in a black-box setting. The client aims to minimize inference cost by distilling the VLM to a student model using the limited available task-specific data and further deploying this student model in the downstream application. While naive distillation largely improves the In-Domain (ID) accuracy of the student it fails to transfer the superior out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of the VLM teacher using the limited available labeled images. To mitigate this we propose Vision-Language to Vision - Align Distill Predict (VL2V-ADiP) which first aligns the vision and language modalities of the teacher model with the vision modality of a pre-trained student model and further distills the aligned VLM representations to the student. This maximally retains the pre-trained features of the student while also incorporating the rich representations of the VLM image encoder and the superior generalization of the text embeddings. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard Domain Generalization benchmarks in a black-box teacher setting as well as a white-box setting where the weights of the VLM are accessible."

Although vision-language models (VLMs) integrate LLM modules (1) aligned with static image features and (2) may possess prior knowledge of world dynamics (as demonstrated in the text world) they have not been trained in an embodied visual world and thus cannot align with its dynamics. On the other hand training an embodied agent in a noisy visual world without expert guidance is often challenging and inefficient. In this paper we train a VLM agent living in a visual world using an LLM agent excelling in a parallel text world. Specifically we distill LLM's reflection outcomes (improved actions by analyzing mistakes) in a text world's tasks to finetune the VLM on the same tasks of the visual world resulting in an Embodied Multi-Modal Agent (EMMA) quickly adapting to the visual world dynamics. Such cross-modality imitation learning between the two parallel worlds is achieved by a novel DAgger-DPO algorithm enabling EMMA to generalize to a broad scope of new tasks without any further guidance from the LLM expert.

Connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) and vision models MLLMs are proficient in understanding contexts with visual inputs. Among them LISA as a representative adopts a special [SEG] token to prompt a segmentation mask decoder e.g. SAM to enable MLLMs in the RES task.

Departing from traditional numerical regression models which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

We investigate this phenomenon usually referred to as \"hallucination\" and show that it stems from an excessive reliance on the language prior. In particular we show that as more tokens are generated the reliance on the visual prompt decreases and this behavior strongly correlates with the emergence of hallucinations. To reduce hallucinations we introduce Multi-Modal Mutual-Information Decoding (M3ID) a new sampling method for prompt amplification. M3ID amplifies the influence of the reference image over the language prior hence favoring the generation of tokens with higher mutual information with the visual prompt. M3ID can be applied to any pre-trained autoregressive VLM at inference time without necessitating further training and with minimal computational overhead. If training is an option we show that M3ID can be paired with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve the model's reliance on the prompt image without requiring any labels. Our empirical findings show that our algorithms maintain the fluency and linguistic capabilities of pre-trained VLMs while reducing hallucinations by mitigating visually ungrounded answers. Specifically for the LLaVA 13B model M3ID and M3ID+DPO reduce the percentage of hallucinated objects in captioning tasks by 25% and 28% respectively and improve the accuracy on VQA benchmarks such as POPE by 21% and 24%."

However measuring the frequency of concepts in VLMs' large-scale datasets is challenging. We address this by using large language models (LLMs) to count the number of pretraining texts that contain synonyms of these concepts. Our analysis confirms that popular datasets such as LAION exhibit a long-tailed concept distribution yielding biased performance in VLMs. We also find that downstream applications of VLMs including visual chatbots (e.g. GPT-4V) and text-to-image models (e.g. Stable Diffusion) often fail to recognize or generate images of rare concepts identified by our method. To mitigate the imbalanced performance of zero-shot VLMs we propose REtrieval-Augmented Learning (REAL). First instead of prompting VLMs using the original class names REAL uses their most frequent synonyms found in pretraining texts. This simple change already outperforms costly human-engineered and LLM-enriched prompts over nine benchmark datasets. Second REAL trains a linear classifier on a small yet balanced set of pretraining data retrieved using concept synonyms.

Moreover the category names are directly used to extract text embeddings for the downstream tasks making it hardly possible to represent the semantics of multi-modal data. The 'out-of-the-box' insight of our UniBind is to make the alignment center modality-agnostic and further learn a unified and balanced representation space empowered by the large language models (LLMs). UniBind is superior in its flexible application to all CLIP-style models and delivers remarkable performance boosts. To make this possible we 1) construct a knowledge base of text embeddings with the help of LLMs and multi-modal LLMs; 2) adaptively build LLM-augmented class-wise embedding center on top of the knowledge base and encoded visual embeddings; 3) align all the embeddings to the LLM-augmented embedding center via contrastive learning to achieve a unified and balanced representation space.

Leveraging the powerful capabilities of multimodal LLMs ChatPose unifies classical 3D human pose and generation tasks while offering user interactions. Additionally ChatPose empowers LLMs to apply their extensive world knowledge in reasoning about human poses leading to two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning about pose estimation. These tasks involve reasoning about humans to generate 3D poses from subtle text queries possibly accompanied by images. We establish benchmarks for these tasks moving beyond traditional 3D pose generation and estimation methods.

The panel is obtained through arranging the visual concepts parsed from the input text by the aid of large language models and then injected into the denoising network as a detailed control signal to complement the text condition. To facilitate text-to-panel learning we come up with a carefully designed semantic formatting protocol accompanied by a fully-automatic data preparation pipeline. Thanks to such a design our approach which we call Ranni manages to enhance a pre-trained T2I generator regarding its textual controllability. More importantly the introduction of the generative middleware brings a more convenient form of interaction (i.e. directly adjusting the elements in the panel or using language instructions) and further allows users to finely customize their generation based on which we develop a practical system and showcase its potential in continuous generation and chatting-based editing."

        "abstract": "Text-to-image person re-identification (ReID) retrieves pedestrian images according to textual descriptions. Manually annotating textual descriptions is time-consuming restricting the scale of existing datasets and therefore the generalization ability of ReID models. As a result we study the transferable text-to-image ReID problem where we train a model on our proposed large-scale database and directly deploy it to various datasets for evaluation. We obtain substantial training data via Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Moreover we identify and address two key challenges in utilizing the obtained textual descriptions. First an MLLM tends to generate descriptions with similar structures causing the model to overfit specific sentence patterns. Thus we propose a novel method that uses MLLMs to caption images according to various templates. These templates are obtained using a multi-turn dialogue with a Large Language Model (LLM). Therefore we can build a large-scale dataset with diverse textual descriptions. Second an MLLM may produce incorrect descriptions. Hence we introduce a novel method that automatically identifies words in a description that do not correspond with the image. This method is based on the similarity between one text and all patch token embeddings in the image. Then we mask these words with a larger probability in the subsequent training epoch alleviating the impact of noisy textual descriptions. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly boost the direct transfer text-to-image ReID performance. Benefiting from the pre-trained model weights we also achieve state-of-the-art performance in the traditional evaluation settings."

We propose the Language-Regularized Concept Learner (LARC) which uses constraints from language as regularization to significantly improve the accuracy of neuro-symbolic concept learners in the naturally supervised setting. Our approach is based on two core insights: the first is that language constraints (e.g. a word's relation to another) can serve as effective regularization for structured representations in neuro-symbolic models; the second is that we can query large language models to distill such constraints from language properties. We show that LARC improves performance of prior works in naturally supervised 3D visual grounding and demonstrates a wide range of 3D visual reasoning capabilities--from zero-shot composition to data efficiency and transferability. Our method represents a promising step towards regularizing structured visual reasoning frameworks with language-based priors for learning in settings without dense supervision."

In this paper we propose Osprey a mask-text instruction tuning approach to extend MLLMs by incorporating fine-grained mask regions into language instruction aiming at achieving pixel-wise visual understanding. To achieve this goal we first meticulously curate a mask-based region-text dataset with 724K samples and then design a vision-language model by injecting pixel-level representation into LLM. Specifically Osprey adopts a convolutional CLIP backbone as the vision encoder and employs a mask-aware visual extractor to extract precise visual mask features from high resolution input.

Building on this we propose Time-step Few-shot (TiF) learner. We train class-specific low-rank adapters for a text-conditioned DM to make up for the lost attributes such that images can be accurately reconstructed from their noisy ones given a prompt. Hence at a small time-step the adapter and prompt are essentially a parameterization of only the nuanced class attributes.

In this paper we present ViT-Lens that facilitates efficient omni-modal representation learning by perceiving novel modalities with a pretrained ViT and aligning them to a pre-defined space.

ViT-Lens provides a unified solution for representation learning of increasing modalities with two appealing advantages: (i) Unlocking the great potential of pretrained ViTs to novel modalities effectively with efficient data regime; (ii) Enabling emergent downstream capabilities through modality alignment and shared ViT parameters.

LMDrive uniquely processes and integrates multi-modal sensor data with natural language instructions enabling interaction with humans and navigation software in realistic instructional settings. To facilitate further research in language-based closed-loop autonomous driving we also publicly release the corresponding dataset which includes approximately 64K instruction-following data clips and the LangAuto benchmark that tests the system's ability to handle complex instructions and challenging driving scenarios. Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted to demonstrate LMDrive's effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge we're the very first work to leverage LLMs for closed-loop end-to-end autonomous driving. Code is available at https://github.com/opendilab/LMDrive"

        "abstract": "Although soft prompt tuning is effective in efficiently adapting Vision-Language (V&L) models for downstream tasks it shows limitations in dealing with distribution shifts. We address this issue with Attribute-Guided Prompt Tuning (ArGue) making three key contributions. 1) In contrast to the conventional approach of directly appending soft prompts preceding class names we align the model with primitive visual attributes generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). We posit that a model's ability to express high confidence in these attributes signifies its capacity to discern the correct class rationales. 2) We introduce attribute sampling to eliminate disadvantageous attributes thus only semantically meaningful attributes are preserved. 3) We propose negative prompting explicitly enumerating class-agnostic attributes to activate spurious correlations and encourage the model to generate highly orthogonal probability distributions in relation to these negative features. In experiments our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods on both novel class prediction and out-of-distribution generalization tasks."

        "abstract": "The vision and language generative models have been overgrown in recent years. For video generation various open-sourced models and public-available services have been developed to generate high-quality videos. However these methods often use a few metrics e.g. FVD or IS to evaluate the performance. We argue that it is hard to judge the large conditional generative models from the simple metrics since these models are often trained on very large datasets with multi-aspect abilities. Thus we propose a novel framework and pipeline for exhaustively evaluating the performance of the generated videos. Our approach involves generating a diverse and comprehensive list of 700 prompts for text-to-video generation which is based on an analysis of real-world user data and generated with the assistance of a large language model. Then we evaluate the state-of-the-art video generative models on our carefully designed benchmark in terms of visual qualities content qualities motion qualities and text-video alignment with 17 well-selected objective metrics. To obtain the final leaderboard of the models we further fit a series of coefficients to align the objective metrics to the users' opinions. Based on the proposed human alignment method our final score shows a higher correlation than simply averaging the metrics showing the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation method."

In this work we leverage two complementary sources of information -- descriptions of categories generated by large language models (LLMs) and abundant fine-grained image classification datasets -- to improve the zero-shot classification performance of VLMs across fine-grained domains. On the technical side we develop methods to train VLMs with this \"bag-level\" image-text supervision. We find that simply using these attributes at test-time does not improve performance but our training strategy for example on the iNaturalist dataset leads to an average improvement of 4-5% in zero-shot classification accuracy for novel categories of birds and flowers. Similar improvements are observed in domains where a subset of the categories was used to fine-tune the model. By prompting LLMs in various ways we generate descriptions that capture visual appearance habitat and geographic regions and pair them with existing attributes such as the taxonomic structure of the categories. We systematically evaluate their ability to improve zero-shot categorization in natural domains. Our findings suggest that geographic priors can be just as effective and are complementary to visual appearance.

Compared with conventional object detection open vocabulary object detection largely extends the object detection categories. However it relies on calculating the similarity between image regions and a set of arbitrary category names with a pretrained vision-and-language model. This implies that despite its open-set nature the task still needs the predefined object categories during the inference stage. This raises the question: What if we do not have exact knowledge of object categories during inference? In this paper we call such a new setting as generative open-ended object detection which is a more general and practical problem. To address it we formulate object detection as a generative problem and propose a simple framework named GenerateU which can detect dense objects and generate their names in a free-form way. Particularly we employ Deformable DETR as a region proposal generator with a language model translating visual regions to object names. To assess the free-form object detection task we introduce an evaluation method designed to quantitatively measure the performance of generative outcomes.

Different from conventional vision-language tasks VDU is specifically concerned with text-rich scenarios containing abundant document elements. Nevertheless the importance of fine-grained features remains largely unexplored within the community of LVLMs leading to suboptimal performance in text-rich scenarios. In this paper we abbreviate it as the fine-grained feature collapse issue. With the aim of filling this gap we propose a contrastive learning framework termed Document Object COntrastive learning (DoCo) specifically tailored for the downstream tasks of VDU. DoCo leverages an auxiliary multimodal encoder to obtain the features of document objects and align them to the visual features generated by the vision encoder of LVLM which enhances visual representation in text-rich scenarios. It can represent that the contrastive learning between the visual holistic representations and the multimodal fine-grained features of document objects can assist the vision encoder in acquiring more effective visual cues thereby enhancing the comprehension of text-rich documents in LVLMs. We also demonstrate that the proposed DoCo serves as a plug-and-play pre-training method which can be employed in the pre-training of various LVLMs without inducing any increase in computational complexity during the inference process. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks of VDU reveal that LVLMs equipped with our proposed DoCo can achieve superior performance and mitigate the gap between VDU and generic vision-language tasks."

Unified-IO 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the multi-task GRIT benchmark and achieves strong results on 30 diverse datasets including SEED-Bench image and video understanding TIFA image generation VQA 2.0 ScienceQA VIMA robotic manipulation VGG-Sound and Kinetics-Sounds and can perform unseen tasks and generate free-form responses.

        "abstract": "We present OAKINK2 a dataset of bimanual object manipulation tasks for complex daily activities. In pursuit of constructing the complex tasks into a structured representation OAKINK2 introduces three level of abstraction to organize the manipulation tasks: Affordance Primitive Task and Complex Task. OAKINK2 features on an object-centric perspective for decoding the complex tasks treating them as a sequence of object affordance fulfillment. The first level Affordance outlines the functionalities that objects in the scene can afford the second level Primitive Task describes the minimal interaction units that humans interact with the object to achieve its affordance and the third level Complex Task illustrates how Primitive Tasks are composed and interdependent. OAKINK2 dataset provides multi-view image streams and precise pose annotations for the human body hands and various interacting objects. This extensive collection supports applications such as interaction reconstruction and motion synthesis. Based on the 3-level abstraction of OAKINK2 we explore a task-oriented framework for Complex Task Completion (CTC). CTC aims to generate a sequence of bimanual manipulation to achieve task objectives. Within the CTC framework we employ Large Language Models (LLMs) to decompose the complex task objectives into sequences of Primitive Tasks and have developed a Motion Fulfillment Model that generates bimanual hand motion for each Primitive Task. OAKINK2 datasets and models are available at https://oakink.net/v2."

In this paper we present a novel framework to harness human feedback for instructional visual editing (HIVE). Specifically we collect human feedback on the edited images and learn a reward function to capture the underlying user preferences. We then introduce scalable diffusion model fine-tuning methods that can incorporate human preferences based on the estimated reward. Besides to mitigate the bias brought by the limitation of data we contribute a new 1.1M training dataset a 3.6K reward dataset for rewards learning and a 1K evaluation dataset to boost the performance of instructional image editing. We conduct extensive empirical experiments quantitatively and qualitatively showing that HIVE is favored over previous state-of-the-art instructional image editing approaches by a large margin."

As these models see large-scale deployments it is necessary to deeply investigate their safety and fairness to not disseminate and perpetuate any kind of biases. However existing works focus on detecting closed sets of biases defined a priori limiting the studies to well-known concepts. In this paper we tackle the challenge of open-set bias detection in text-to-image generative models presenting OpenBias a new pipeline that identifies and quantifies the severity of biases agnostically without access to any precompiled set. OpenBias has three stages. In the first phase we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to propose biases given a set of captions. Secondly the target generative model produces images using the same set of captions. Lastly a Vision Question Answering model recognizes the presence and extent of the previously proposed biases. We study the behavior of Stable Diffusion 1.5 2 and XL emphasizing new biases never investigated before. Via quantitative experiments we demonstrate that OpenBias agrees with current closed-set bias detection methods and human judgement."

        "abstract": "Leveraging vast training data multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated formidable general visual comprehension capabilities and achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However their performance in visual document understanding still leaves much room for improvement. This discrepancy is primarily attributed to the fact that visual document understanding is a fine-grained prediction task. In natural scenes MLLMs typically use low-resolution images leading to a substantial loss of visual information. Furthermore general-purpose MLLMs do not excel in handling document-oriented instructions. In this paper we propose a High-Resolution Visual Document Assistant (HRVDA) which bridges the gap between MLLMs and visual document understanding. This model employs a content filtering mechanism and an instruction filtering module to separately filter out the content-agnostic visual tokens and instruction-agnostic visual tokens thereby achieving efficient model training and inference for high-resolution images. In addition we construct a document-oriented visual instruction tuning dataset and apply a multi-stage training strategy to enhance the model's document modeling capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple document understanding datasets while maintaining training efficiency and inference speed comparable to low-resolution models."

It serves as a crucial basis for academic tutoring technical support and more practical applications. DQA poses significant challenges such as the demand for domain-specific knowledge and the scarcity of annotated data which restrict the applicability of large-scale deep models. Previous approaches have explored external knowledge integration through pre-training but these methods are costly and can be limited by domain disparities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in question-answering there is still a gap in how to cooperate and interact with the diagram parsing process. In this paper we introduce the Chain-of-Guiding Learning Model for Diagram Question Answering (CoG-DQA) a novel framework that effectively addresses DQA challenges. CoG-DQA leverages LLMs to guide diagram parsing tools (DPTs) through the guiding chains enhancing the precision of diagram parsing while introducing rich background knowledge. Our experimental findings reveal that CoG-DQA surpasses all comparison models in various DQA scenarios achieving an average accuracy enhancement exceeding 5% and peaking at 11% across four datasets. These results underscore CoG-DQA's capacity to advance the field of visual question answering and promote the integration of LLMs into specialized domains."

In contrast learning in humans often involves additional detailed guidance throughout the interactive learning process i.e. where feedback often via language provides detailed information as to which part of their trial was performed incorrectly or suboptimally and why. Motivated by this observation we introduce an efficient feedback-based framework for improving behavior-cloning-based training of sensorimotor driving agents. Our key insight is to leverage recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide corrective fine-grained feedback regarding the underlying reason behind driving prediction failures. Moreover our introduced network architecture is efficient enabling the first sensorimotor end-to-end training and evaluation of LLM-based driving models. The resulting agent achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-loop evaluation on nuScenes outperforming prior state-of-the-art by over 8.1% and 57.1% in accuracy and collision rate respectively. In CARLA our camera-based agent improves by 16.6% in driving score over prior LIDAR-based approaches."

Prompt learning methods built with VL models generate text features from the class names that only have confined class-specific information. Large Language Models (LLMs) with their vast encyclopedic knowledge emerge as the complement. Thus in this paper we discuss the integration of LLMs to enhance pre-trained VL models specifically on low-shot classification. However the domain gap between language and vision blocks the direct application of LLMs. Thus we propose LLaMP Large Language Models as Prompt learners that produces adaptive prompts for the CLIP text encoder establishing it as the connecting bridge. Experiments show that compared with other state-of-the-art prompt learning methods LLaMP yields better performance on both zero-shot generalization and few-shot image classification over a spectrum of 11 datasets.

There have been growing efforts on visual instruction tuning to extend the LLM with visual inputs but lacks an in-depth study of the visual language pre-training process where the model learns to perform joint modeling on both modalities. In this work we examine the design options for VLM pre-training by augmenting LLM towards VLM through step-by-step con- trollable comparisons. We introduce three main findings: (1) freezing LLMs during pre-training can achieve decent zero-shot performance but lack in-context learning capabil- ity which requires unfreezing the LLM; (2) interleaved pre- training data is beneficial whereas image-text pairs alone are not optimal; (3) re-blending text-only instruction data to image-text data during instruction fine-tuning not only remedies the degradation of text-only tasks but also boosts VLM task accuracy. With an enhanced pre-training recipe we build VILA a Visual Language model family that consis- tently outperforms the state-of-the-art models e.g. LLaVA- 1.5 across main benchmarks without bells and whistles. Multi-modal pre-training also helps unveil appealing prop- erties of VILA including multi-image reasoning enhanced in-context learning and better world knowledge.

Rather than relying on deep embeddings to connect image and language as the interface representation our approach represents an image as text from which we enjoy the interpretability and flexibility inherent to natural language. We employ an autoencoder that uses a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model for decoding. The encoder is trained to transform an input image into text which is then fed into the fixed text-to-image diffusion decoder to reconstruct the original input a process we term De-Diffusion. Experiments validate both the precision and comprehensiveness of De-Diffusion text representing images such that it can be readily ingested by off-the-shelf text-to-image tools and LLMs for diverse multi-modal tasks. For example a single De-Diffusion model can generalize to provide transferable prompts for different text-to-image tools and also achieves a new state of the art on open-ended vision-language tasks by simply prompting large language models with few-shot examples.

        "abstract": "The combination of strong visual backbones and Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning has led to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) becoming the current standard for a wide range of vision and language (VL) tasks. However recent research has shown that even the most advanced LMMs still struggle to capture aspects of compositional visual reasoning such as attributes and relationships between objects. One solution is to utilize scene graphs (SGs)---a formalization of objects and their relations and attributes that has been extensively used as a bridge between the visual and textual domains. Yet scene graph data requires scene graph annotations which are expensive to collect and thus not easily scalable. Moreover finetuning an LMM based on SG data can lead to catastrophic forgetting of the pretraining objective. To overcome this inspired by chain-of-thought methods we propose Compositional Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) a novel zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting method that utilizes SG representations in order to extract compositional knowledge from an LMM. Specifically we first generate an SG using the LMM and then use that SG in the prompt to produce a response. Through extensive experiments we find that the proposed CCoT approach not only improves LMM performance on several vision and language VL compositional benchmarks but also improves the performance of several popular LMMs on general multimodal benchmarks without the need for fine-tuning or annotated ground-truth SGs.

However prior zero-shot HOI detectors often employ the same levels of feature maps to model HOIs with varying distances leading to suboptimal performance in scenes containing human-object pairs with a wide range of distances. In addition these detectors primarily rely on category names and overlook the rich contextual information that language can provide which is essential for capturing open vocabulary concepts that are typically rare and not well-represented by category names alone. In this paper we introduce a novel end-to-end open vocabulary HOI detection framework with conditional multi-level decoding and fine-grained semantic enhancement (CMD-SE) harnessing the potential of Visual-Language Models (VLMs). Specifically we propose to model human-object pairs with different distances with different levels of feature maps by incorporating a soft constraint during the bipartite matching process. Furthermore by leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT models we exploit their extensive world knowledge to generate descriptions of human body part states for various interactions. Then we integrate the generalizable and fine-grained semantics of human body parts to improve interaction recognition. Experimental results on two datasets SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in open vocabulary HOI detection.
